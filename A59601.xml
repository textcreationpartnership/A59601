         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I do earneſtly (and I ſuppoſe rationally and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturally) hope that this <hi>veritas magna</hi> thoſe ſacred Oracles will yet much more <hi>prevail,</hi> and that the founder of this moſt excellent <hi>Religion,</hi> who was <hi>lift up</hi> upon the croſs, and is more <hi>exalted</hi> to his Throne, will yet <hi>draw</hi> more men unto himſelf: and this perhaps is all the <hi>millennium</hi> that we can warrantably look for. But in the mean time, it is too too evident that the Kingdom of Sathan doth more obtain in the World, than the Goſpel of Chriſt, either in the <hi>Letter,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> of it. As to the <hi>former,</hi> if we will receive the probable conjecture of learned enquirers, we ſhall not find above one ſixth part of the known World yet Chriſtianized, or giving ſo much as an external adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Crucified Jeſus.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cauſes of the non-propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the former ſenſe; only it is eaſie and obvious to gueſs, that few will enter in by <hi>the way of the tree of life,</hi> when the ſame is guarded with a <hi>flaming ſword;</hi> And it were reaſonable to hope, that if the minds of Chriſtians were more purged from a <hi>ſelfiſh bitterneſs, fierce animoſity,</hi> and <hi>arbitrary ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and poſſeſt with a more <hi>free, generous, benign, compaſſionate, condeſcending, candid, charitable,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt-like</hi> ſpirit, which would be indulgent toward ſuch as are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent under a leſs perfect diſpenſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as our<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 49, 50, 54 55.</note> Saviours was) would not impoſe any thing harſh or unneceſſary upon the ſacred and inviolable Conſciences of men, but would allow and maintain that liberty to men, which is juſt and natural to them in matters of Religion, and no way forfeited by them; then I ſay it might be reaſonable to hope, that the innate power and vertue of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel would prove moſt victorious; <hi>Judaiſme, Mahumetiſme,</hi> and <hi>Paganiſme</hi> would melt away under its powerfull influences, and <hi>Sathan</hi> himſelf <hi>fall down as lightning</hi> before it, as naturally as the eye-lids of the morning do chaſe away the blackneſs of the night, when once they are lift up upon the earth. But my deſign is chiefly to examine the true and proper cauſe of the non-progreſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as to the <hi>power</hi> of it, and its inefficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon the hearts and Conſciences of thoſe that do profeſs it. And now in finding
<pb facs="tcp:103119:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> out the cauſe hereof, I ſhall content my ſelf to be <hi>wiſe on this ſide Heaven,</hi> leaving that daring courſe of ſearching the decrees of God, and riffing into the hidden rolls of eternity, to them who can digeſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable notion of a ſelf-willed, arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and imperious Deity; which I doubt is the moſt vulgar apprehenſion of God, men meaſuring him moſt groſly and unhappily by a <hi>ſelf-ſtandard.</hi> And as I dare not ſoar ſo high, ſo neither will I adventure to ſtoop ſo low, as to rake into particulars; which are differently aſſigned, according to the different humours and intereſts of them that do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them; each party in the world being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 75. 3.</note> 
               <hi>inhabitants of it are diſſolved, I bear up the pillars of it;</hi> ready to think that the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion in the world is involved in them and their perſwaſions and <hi>dogmas,</hi> and that the whole Church is undone, if but an hair fall from their heads, if they be in the leaſt injured or abridged. Which is a peece of very great fondneſs, and indeed the more unpardonable, in as much as it deſtroys the deſign of the Goſpel, in confining and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and making God as <hi>topical,</hi> as he was when he dwelt no where upon earth but at the Temple in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Waving theſe extreams therefore, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the true cauſe in general of the ſo little prevailing of true Religion in the hearts and lives of men is <hi>the falſe notion that men have
<pb facs="tcp:103119:4"/> of it,</hi> placing it there where indeed it is not, nor doth conſiſt. That this muſt needs be a cauſe of the not prevailing of the Goſpel whereever it is found, I ſuppoſe every body will grant; and that it is almoſt every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found, will I doubt too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear by that deſcription of true Chriſtian Religion, which the moſt ſacred Author of it the Lord Jeſus Chriſt made to the poor Samaritaneſs; which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured briefly to explain, according to the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nour of the Goſpel, in this ſmall Treatiſe; which I firſt framed for private uſe, in a ſeaſon when it was moſt behovefull for me to underſtand the utmoſt ſecrets of my own ſoul, and do the utmoſt ſervice I was able towards the ſalvation of thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my roof; expecting every day to render up my own or their ſouls into the arms of our moſt mercifull Redeemer, and to be fully ſwallowed up into that <hi>eternal life,</hi> into which true Religion daily ſprings up, and will at length infallibly conduct the Chriſtian ſoul unto. This work thus undertaken and in a great meaſure then carryed on, I have ſince perfected, and do here preſent to the peruſal of my dear Countrey, having made it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick for no private end; but if it might be to ſerve the intereſt of Gods glory in the world: which I do verily reckon that I ſhall do, if by his bleſſing I may be inſtrumental to <hi>undeceive</hi> any ſoul <hi>miſtaken</hi> in ſo high and concerning a matter as <hi>Religion</hi> is, or any way to <hi>awaken</hi> and quicken any <hi>Religious</hi> ſoul not ſufficiently <hi>raviſht</hi> with the unſpeakable glory,

            </p>
            <p>What a certain and undefeatable tendency true <hi>Religion</hi> hath towards the eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſalvation of mens ſouls, will I hope evidently appear out of the body of this ſmall Treatiſe: But that's not all (though indeed that were enough to commend it to any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſoul, that is any whit free and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and is not ſo perfectly debauched as to utterly from right reaſon;) For it is alſo the ſincereſt pollicy imaginable, and the moſt unerring expedient in the world for the uniting and eſtabliſhing of a divided and tottering Kingdom or Common-wealth: To demonſtrate which, was the very deſign of this <hi>Preface.</hi> It is well known (Oh that it were but as well and effectually believed!) that <hi>godlineſs is profitable to all things,</hi> and that it<note place="margin">1 Tom. 4. 8.</note> hath the promiſes and bleſſings of the <hi>life that now is, and of that which is to come;</hi> that the right ſeeking of the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs hath no leſs than <hi>all things</hi>

Come they not hence, even of your luſts that war in your members?</hi> Here let me deſire one thing of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and that is, to bear in his mind all along where he finds the word [<hi>Religion,</hi>] that I have principally a reſpect to the deſcription given of it in the Text, and that I mean thereby <hi>a divine principle implanted in the ſoul ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I ſhould briefly touch thoſe faults both in governours towards their ſubjects, ſubjects towards their governours, and towards each other, which do deſtroy the peacefull ſtate and the ſound and happy conſtitution of a body politick: And indeed I fear it will run upon ſome inconvenience, if not confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to wave this method. But out of a pure deſire to avoid whatever may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretable to ill will, curioſity, preſumption, or any other bad diſpoſition, and that it may appear to any ingenuous eye that I am more deſirous to bind up, than to rake into ſores, I will <hi>expreſly</hi> ſhew how Religion would heale the diſtempers of any Nation, without taking any more than an <hi>implicite</hi> notice of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> Then, it is undoubtedly true, that Religion deeply radicated in the nature of Princes and governours would moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally qualifie them for the moſt happy way of reigning. Every body knows well enough what an excellent <hi>Eucraſie</hi> and lovely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb facs="tcp:103119:6"/> the Jewiſh polity was in, under the influences of holy <hi>David,</hi> wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> zealous <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and others of the ſame ſpirit; ſo that I need not ſpend my ſelf in that enquiry, and ſo conſequently not upon that argument. Now there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, by which it is eaſie to conceive that <hi>Religion</hi> would rectifie and well temper the ſpirits of Princes.</p>
            <p>This principle will verily conſtitute the moſt noble, heroical, and royal ſoul, in as much as it will not ſuffer men to find any unhallowed ſatisfaction in a divine authority, but will be ſpringing up into a <hi>Godlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as their greateſt and moſt perfective glory. It will certainly correct and limit the over-eager affectation of unweildy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unbounded Dominion, by teaching them that the moſt honourable victory in the world is <hi>ſelf-conqueſt,</hi> and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the image and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God in their own ſouls is infinitely preferrible to the advancement or enlargement of any <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral jurisdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame holy principle (being the moſt genuine off-ſpring of divine Love and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity) will alſo poliſh their rough and over-ſevere natures, inſtruct them in the moſt ſweet and obliging methods of government; by aſſimulating them to the nature of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 22. 2 Cor. 3. 17.</note> who is infinitely abhorrent from all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of oppreſſion, and hath moſt admirably provided that his <hi>ſervants</hi> ſhould not be <hi>ſlaves,</hi> by making his ſervice perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:103119:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The pure and impartial nature of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure ſuperſtitious flatterers, or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical profeſſors; and the Princes of the Earth that are regenerate into his Image, will alſo eſtimate men according to God; I mean according to his <hi>example,</hi> who loves nothing but the communications of himſelf, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>v. 2. 11.</note> to their participation of his <hi>Image,</hi> which is only amiable and advanceable in the world. What God rejected in his fire-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Religion will teach Princes to diſguſt in the devotions (as they call them) of their Courtiers; I mean not only the <hi>leaven</hi> of ſuperſtitious pride and dogged moroſity, but alſo the <hi>honey</hi> of mercenary proſtrations and fawning adulations.</p>
            <p>In a word, this Religious principle which makes God its <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> ſprings <hi>from him</hi> and is alwayes ſpringing up <hi>into him,</hi> would ſoveraignty heal the diſtempers of ruling by humour, ſelf-intereſt, and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, and teach men to ſeek the good of the publick before ſelf-gratifications. For ſo God rules the world, who (however ſome men ſlander him) I dare ſay hath made nothing the <hi>duty</hi> of his creature, but what is really the <hi>good</hi> of it: neither doth he give his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Laws on purpoſe that he might ſhew his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> in making them, or his <hi>juſtice</hi> in puniſhing the breach of them; much leſs doth he give them any ſuch ſtatutes, as which himſelf would as willingly they broke as kept, ſo he might but the penalty.</p>
            <p>What I have briefly ſaid concerning <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> governours, the judicious Reader may
<pb facs="tcp:103119:7"/> view over again and apply to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> For I do verily reckon that if the hearts of theſe men were in that right Religious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and <hi>holy order</hi> which I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, it would plentifully contribute towards the happy and bleſsfull ſtate of any Kingdom. I will ſpeak freely (let it light where it will,) that principle that ſprings up into popular applauſe, ſecular greatneſs, worldly pomp and bravery, fleſh-pleaſing, or any kind of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tation (which is manifold;) is really contradiſtinct from that Divine principle, that Religious nature that ſprings up into <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> And certainly notwithſtanding all the recr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>minations and ſelf-juſtifications which are on all hands uſed to ſhuffle of the guilt, theſe governours muſt lay aſide their fullen pride, as well as the people their proud fullenneſs, before the Church of God be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its breaches, purged of Antichriſtianiſm, or can probably arrive at any ſound conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or perfect ſtature.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe Religion will not have its full and deſirable effect upon a Nation by heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſickly heads of it; except it be like the holy oyle powred upon the ſacrificer's head, which ran down alſo upon the skirts of his<note place="margin">Pſal. 133. 2.</note> garment. Therefore</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is indiſpenſably requiſite for the through healing and right conſtituting of any political body, that the <hi>ſubjects</hi> therein be thus Divinely principled. This will not fail to diſpoſe them rightly <hi>towards their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urs</hi> and <hi>towards one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Towards their Governours.</hi> There are
<pb facs="tcp:103119:7"/> many evil and perverſe diſpoſitions in <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> towards their <hi>Rulers;</hi> all which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the moſt excellent expedient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie.</p>
            <p>The firſt and fundamental diſtemper here ſeems to be <hi>a want of due Reverence toward theſe vicegerents of God upon earth;</hi> which eaſily grows up into ſomething poſitive, and becomes <hi>a ſecret wiſhing of evil</hi> to them. This fault, as light as ſome eſteem it, was<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 16. Prov. 30. 16. 1 Joh. 3. 15.</note> ſeverely puniſhed in Queen <hi>Michal,</hi> who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed</hi> her Lord King <hi>David in her heart,</hi> and her <hi>barren womb</hi> went down to its Siſter the <hi>grave</hi> under great reproach. And if an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hatred be ſo fouly interpreted by the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Whoſoever hateth his brother is a murderer;</hi> ſurely diſloyal and malignant diſpoſitions towards governours muſt needs have a fouler face; and we may ſay by a parity of reaſon <hi>whoſoever hateth his Prince is a Rebel and a Regicide.</hi> Now this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as fundamental and epidemical as it is, the ſpirit of true <hi>Religion</hi> will heal, and I think I may ſay that only: For I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world that hath, nay I know that nothing in the world hath that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and dominion over the diſpoſitions and affections of the ſoul, as this principle throughly ingrafted in the ſoul doth challenge to itſelf. This alone can frame the heart of man into that beautifull temper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>loyalty,</hi> that he will not <hi>curſe the King,</hi> no not in his <hi>conſcience;</hi> no<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 20.</note> not though he were well aſſured that there were no winged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <pb facs="tcp:103119:8"/>
            <p>An other diſtemper in Subjects reſpective to their Governours is <hi>Impatience of bearing a yoke.</hi> Which is an evil ſo natural to the proud and imperious ſpirit of man, that I believe it were ſafe to affirm, that every irreligious ſubject could be well content to be a Prince; however there may be many who utterly deſpairing of ſuch event, may with the Fox in the Fable, profeſs they care not for it, From this principle of pride and impatience of ſubjection I ſuſpect it is, that the rigid <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> do ſo ſcornfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt, and ſo loudly decry the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ordinances</hi> of Magiſtracy and Miniſtry: not that they do verily ſeek the advancement of Chriſts Kingdom, (which indeed every diſorderly, tumultuous, proud, impatient ſoul doth <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deny and deſtroy) but of themſelves. To whom one might juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the cenſure which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> injuriouſly pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">Exod. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>us go and do Sacrifice to the Lord.</hi> This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper the power of Religion would excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently heal, by mortifying ambitious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and quieting the impatient turbulencies of the fretfull and envious ſoul, by faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart to a right humble frame and cheerful ſubmiſſion to every ordination of God. You will ſee in this Treatiſe, that a right Religious ſoul, powerfully ſpringing up into everlaſting life, hath no liſt nor leiſure to attend to ſuch poor attainments and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acqueſts, as the Lording it over other men; being feelingly acquainted with a life
<pb facs="tcp:103119:8"/> far more excellent than the moſt Princely, and being overpowred with a ſupream and Soveraign good, which charms all its inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate ragings, and laying hold upon all its faculties, draws them forth by a pleaſing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence unto a moſt zealous purſuit of itſelf. A principle of humility makes men good ſubjects; and they that are indeed probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for another world, may very well behave themſelves with a noble diſdain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the glories and preferments of this.</p>
            <p>The laſt diſtemper that I ſhall name in Subjects toward their Governours is <hi>Diſeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents about conceited miſgovernment and mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration;</hi> which commonly ſpring from an <hi>evil and finiſter interpretation of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers actions,</hi> and are attended with <hi>an evil and tumultuous zeal for relaxation.</hi> Now this diſtemper, as great as it is, and deſtructive to the well-being of a body politick, true Religion would heal both root and branch. Were that noble part and branch of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion <hi>univerſal Charity</hi> rightly ſeated in the ſoul, it would not ſuffer the Son of the bond-woman to inherit with it; it would caſt out thoſe irefull jealouſies, ſowre ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, harſh ſurmiſes, and imbittered thoughts which lodge in unhallowed minds, and diſplay itſelf in a moſt amicable ſweetneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of diſpoſition, in fair gloſſes upon doubtfull actions, friendly cenſures or none at all, kind extenuations of greater faults and covering of leſſer.

               <hi>evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Charity</hi> doth put up this root of diſcontents, ſo will <hi>faith</hi> allay and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe <hi>diſcontents</hi> themſelves, which are about miſgovernment and ill adminiſtration. This noble principle adminiſters eaſe and ſatisfaction to the ſoul, if ſhe happen to be provoked: For it will not ſuffer her long to ſtand gazing upon ſecond cauſes; but carries her up in a ſeaſonable contemplation to the ſupream cauſe, without whom no diſorder could ever befall the world; and there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands her to repoſe her ſelf, to wit in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of infinite wiſdome and grace, waiting for a comfortable iſſue. He may well be vext indeed, that has ſo much <hi>reaſon</hi> as to obſerve the many monſtrous diſorders which are in the world, and not ſo much <hi>faith</hi> as to eye the inſcrutable providence of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign and all-wiſe God, who permitteth the ſame with reſpect to the moſt beautifull end and bleſſed order imaginable. Though faith abhors the blaſph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>my of laying blame upon God, yet it ſo fixes the ſoul upon him, and cauſes her ſo to eye his <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>end</hi> in all mal-adminiſtrations of men, that ſhe hath no leiſure to fall out with men, or quarrel with inſtruments.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:103119:9"/>
            <p>Theſe Diſcontents I ſaid were frequently attended with <hi>an evil and ſeditious zeal for relaxation,</hi> diſcovering itſelf in ſecret trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>conſpiracies,</hi> and many times in boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous and <hi>daring attempts.</hi> Theſe are at the firſt ſight ſo directly contrary to the character given of Religious men, viz. <hi>the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 35. 20. Gal. 5. 22, 23. Col. 3. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>quiet of the Land,</hi> and the genius of Religion which is wholly made up of <hi>love, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meekneſs, temperance, mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, forbearance, forgiveneſs, charity, thankfulneſs, wiſdom,</hi> that it is eaſie to conceive that Religion in the power of it would certainly heal this evil diſeaſe alſo. There are many pretenders to Religion, whoſe <hi>complaint</hi> is ſtill concerning <hi>oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>perſecution,</hi> their <hi>cry</hi> is all for <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>deliverance;</hi> but to make it the more paſſable and plauſible, they ſtile it <hi>the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is ſo fair, but withall ſo deceitfull, that I count it worth my time to ſpeak a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more liberally to it. And here I do from the very bottom of my ſoul proteſt, that I account the advancement of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and the Kingdom of Chriſt to be the moſt deſirable thing in the World; and that it is highly becoming the greateſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits upon earth to employ the very utmoſt zeal and diligence to aſſiſt the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: yea ſo utterly do I abhor ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion and Atheiſm, that (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in ſomewhat a like caſe) I do verily<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 18.</note> rejoyce that Chriſt is <hi>profeſſed</hi> though it be
<pb facs="tcp:103119:10"/> but <hi>pretended,</hi> and that <hi>truth</hi> is owned though it be not owned <hi>in truth.</hi> I will further add that the oppreſſing and obſtructing of the external progreſs and propagation of the Goſpel is hated of Chriſt, and to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of all true Chriſtians. Yea I will further allow men a due ſenſibleneſs of their perſonal oppreſſions and injuries, and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural warrantable deſire to be redeemed from them. And now having thus purged my ſelf, I entreat the Chriſtian Reader pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and without prejudice to ſuffer me to ſpeak ſomewhat cloſely to this matter: Yea I do verily aſſure my ſelf that I ſhall be accepted, or at leaſt indulged by all free and ingenuous ſpirits, who are rightly acquainted with the genius of Chriſtian Religion, and do preferr <hi>truth</hi> before <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> For the <hi>complaint,</hi> that is moſtly concerning <hi>oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>perſecution:</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Religion, if it did rightly prevail in our hearts, would very much heal this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, if not by a perfect <hi>ſilencing</hi> of theſe complaints, yet ſurely by <hi>putting them into another tune.</hi> I reckon that Religion quite ſilences theſe complaints when it engages the ſoul ſo entirely in ſerving the end of God in afflictions, and in a right improvement of them for religious purpoſes, that ſhe liſt not to ſpend her ſelf in fruitleſs murmurings and unchriſtian indignations. As fire ſeizeth upon every thing that is combuſtible, and makes it fewel for itſelf, and a predominant humour in the body converts into its own
<pb facs="tcp:103119:10"/> ſubſtance whatever is convertible, and makes it nouriſhment to itſelf; ſo doubtleſs this ſpirit of <hi>burning,</hi> this divine principle, if it were rightly predominant in the ſoul, would nouriſh itſelf by all things that lye in its way, though they ſeem never ſo heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and hard to be digeſted; and rather than want meat, it would with <hi>Sampſon</hi> fetch it out of the very eater himſelf. But if Religion ſhould not utterly ſilence theſe complainings by rendring the ſoul thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of the body, and regardleſs of its ſmart, in compariſon of the happy advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that may be made of it; yet methinks it ſhould draw the main ſtream of theſe tears into an other channel, and put theſe complaints into an other tune. It is very natural to the Religious ſoul to make God <hi>all things</hi> unto itſelf, to lay to heart the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of truth and holineſs more than any particular intereſt of its own; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the diſſervice done to God, more than any ſelf-incommodation. Muſt not he needs be a good ſubject to his Prince, who can more heartily mourn that Gods Laws, are not kept, than that he himſelf is kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that can be more grieved that men are cruel, than that they kill him; that can be more troubled becauſe there are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the world, than becauſe he himſelf is oppreſſed? ſuch ſubjects Religion alone can make.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Cry</hi> that is made for <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>deliverance;</hi> I confeſs I do not eaſily apprehend what is more, or more naturally
<pb facs="tcp:103119:11"/> deſirable than true liberty: yea I believe there are many devout and Religious ſouls, that from a right noble and generous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and out of a ſincere reſpect to the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of their creation, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt intemperately ſtudiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

With what an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, not to ſay diſdainfull eye, would the Religious ſoul look upon the faireſt ſelf-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations in the world; and be ready
<pb facs="tcp:103119:11"/> to ſay within itſelf, What is a meer abſtract deliverance from afflictions worth? Wherein is a naked freedom from afflictions to be accounted of? Will this make me a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man? Was not profane and impudent <hi>Ham</hi> delivered from the deluge of Water, as well as his brethren? Were not the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſhameleſs daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> delivered from the deluge of Fire as well as their Father? And yet we are ſo far from riſing up and calling theſe people bleſſed, that the heart of every chaſt and modeſt Chriſtian is ready to riſe againſt the very mention of their names, when he remembers how both the one and the other, though in a different ſenſe, diſcovered their Fathers nakedneſs. If we did really value our ſelves by our ſouls, and our ſouls themſelves by what they poſſeſs of the Image of God, if we did rightly prefer the advancement of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life before the gratification of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, it is eaſie to conceive how we ſhould prefer patience before proſperity, faith in God before the favour of men, ſpiritual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity before temporal pleaſures or preferments, humility before honour, the denyal of our ſelves before the approbation of others, the advancement of Gods image, before the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our own names, an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of exerciſing gracious diſpoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the exerciſing of any temporal power or ſecular authority, and in a word, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of the beauty, glory and perfections of God before health, wealth, liberty, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, and life itſelf. We ſhould certainly
<pb facs="tcp:103119:12"/> be more indifferently affected towards any condition, whether proſperity, or adverſity, and not be ſo fond of the one, nor weary of the other, if we did verily value them only by the tendency that they had to further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and advance the life of Chriſt in our ſouls. This would certainly make men more ſincerely ſtudious to reap <hi>Gods end in afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them,</hi> and leſs longing to ſee <hi>the end of their afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for <hi>treacheries, plottings, invaſions, uſurpations, rebellions,</hi> and that <hi>tumultuous zeal for Relaxation,</hi> which this impatience of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and fondneſs of deliverance do ſo often grow up into, I dare ſay there is nothing like Religion in the power of it, for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual healing of them. The true ſpirit of Religion is not ſo weary of oppreſſion, though it be by <hi>ſinful men,</hi> as it is abhorrent from deliverance, if it be by <hi>ſinfull means.</hi> May<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1.</note> I not be allowed to allude to the Apoſtle, and ſay, whereas there is amongſt you this zeal, contention, and faction, <hi>are ye not carnal and walk as men?</hi> Is not this the ſame which a meer natural man would do, ſtrive and ſtruggle by right and by wrong to redeem himſelf from whatſoever is grievous and galling to the intereſt of the fleſh? Might it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that if Religion did but diſplay itſelf aright in the powerfull actings of faith, hope and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it would quench this ſcalding zeal, and calm theſe tempeſtuous motions of the ſoul, and make men rather content to be delivered up to the <hi>adverſary,</hi> though the fleſh ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:103119:12"/> by him be deſtroyed, ſo by the ſpirit might be ſaved, and the divine life advanced in the way of the Lord. Oh how dear and precious are the poſſeſſion and practice of <hi>faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titnce, humility,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> to a godly ſoul, in compariſon of all the joyes and toyes, treaſures, pleaſures, eaſe and honour of the world, the ſafety and liberty of the fleſh! How much more then, when theſe muſt be accompliſhed by wicked means, and purchaſed at the rate of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alleadged to defend and patronize theſe ſtrange fervours and frenzies, let me here briefly record to all that ſhall read theſe lines, the way and method of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating his own Kingdom. It will not be denyed but that Chriſt was infinitely ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to promote his own Kingdom in the beſt and moſt proper ſenſe: But I no where read that he ever attempted it by force or fraud, by violent oppoſition or crafty inſinuation. Nay he reckoned that his Kingdom was then truly promoted, when theſe tumultuous, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, imperious, proud luſts of men were mortified. Nothing had been more eaſie with him, conſidering his miraculous power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falſible<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> wiſdom, and the mighty intereſt and party which he could by theſe have made for himſelf in the world, than to have raiſed his <hi>own</hi> Kingdom upon the ruines of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and to have quite ſhuffled <hi>Caeſar</hi> out of the World: but indeed nothing more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb facs="tcp:103119:13"/> conſidering the perfect innocency and infinite Sacredneſs of his temper, nor any thing more contradictious, conſidering the proper notion of his Kingdom; which he profeſſes not be ſecular, and ſo not be maintained by fighting: But if you would<note place="margin">John 18. 16. ver. 37.</note> know in what ſenſe he was a King, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeems to intimate it in his anſwer to <hi>Pilate, Thou ſaiſt that I am a King; to this end was I born that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth:</hi> So then it ſeems, where ever there is <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> predominant, there is Chriſt really enthroned and actually tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant. Where Religion doth vitally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, animate, and actuate mens ſouls, it doth make them rightly to underſtand, that the Kingdom of Chriſt is not the thriving of parties, the ſtrengthning of factions, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of any particular intereſt, though it ſeem to be of never ſo Evangelical a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; nor yet the proſelyting of the World to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, or of the Chriſtian World to the purer and more reformed profeſſion of it (though theſe latter would be a great external honour to the perſon of Chriſt:) but that it is moſt properly and happily propagated in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, and that where ever there is <hi>faith, patience, humility, ſelf denyal, contempt of this world,</hi> and <hi>pregnant hopes of a better, pure obedience to God</hi> and <hi>ſincere benignity to men,</hi> here and there is the Kingdom of God, Chriſt Regnant, and the Goſpel in the power and triumph of it. And may not theſe things
<pb facs="tcp:103119:13"/> be, and be moſt conſpicuouſly, in a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted condition of the Church? That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was an high inſtance of the mighty power of the Divine life in our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> records of him, who <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>when he ſuffered he threatned not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> The ſame divine principle dwelling plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in our ſouls, would inſtruct us to the ſame behaviour, according to the precept given by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Not rendring evil</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>ſor evil, or railing for railing, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bleſſing,</hi> &amp;c. How vainly do men dream that they ſerve the intereſt, and advance the Kingdom of Chriſt, by fierce and raging en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to caſt off every yoke that galls them, and kicking againſt every thorn that pricks them; when indeed they ſerve the intereſt of the fleſh, and do under a fine cloak gratifie the meer animal life, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to ſelf-love; which is as covetous of freedom from all retrenchments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements, as Religion it ſelf can be. It is ſaid indeed, that when the Churches had reſt they were <hi>edified</hi> and <hi>multiplyed;</hi> but when they ſuffer <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> they<note place="margin">Acts 9. 31. 1 Pet. 4. 14. 2 Cor. 12. 19.</note> are then <hi>glorified:</hi> for <hi>the spirit of glory and of God reſteth upon them:</hi> As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſes of himſelf in that moſt noble and heroical paſſage of his to the <hi>Corinthians, Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.
<pb facs="tcp:103119:14"/> Secondly,</hi> Religion will not fail rightly to diſpoſe the hearts <hi>of ſubjects towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and that whether they be of the <hi>ſame</hi> way and judgement with themſelves, or <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> I dare not aſſert that it would make them all of the ſame way and mind; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I believe it would: yet I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it would do more towards this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick union, than all the Laws and ſeverities in the world can. Mutual forbearance and forgiveneſs, Chriſtian kindneſs, and diſcreet condeſcenſions, are the moſt warrantable, and moſt effectual method for introducing <hi>uniformity</hi> and <hi>unanimity</hi> too (which is much better) into the Church of Chriſt. But however, Religion would certainly give a right diſpoſition, and teach men aright behaviour reſpective to each other, whether <hi>friends</hi> or <hi>diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This principle would teach men to love their <hi>friends</hi> and accomplices only <hi>in the Lord,</hi> as his <hi>members,</hi> not as their own <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans.</hi> Are not they ſtrangely devoted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that will vindicate any thing in a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan,</hi> which they will declaim againſt in a <hi>diſſenter?</hi> And yet how is the ſacred name of Chriſtian friendſhip reproached every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by reaſon of this partiality! How much better did true Religion inſtruct the great Apoſtle, <hi>to know no man after the fleſh,</hi> no<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 16.</note> not Chriſt himſelf!</p>
            <p>The ſame principle would not fail to cure the diſtempers of men reſpective to thoſe that are of <hi>a different way and judgement</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103119:14"/> from themſelves; whether of <hi>Preteſtants</hi> towards <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> one towards another. It would heal the diſtempered affections and behaviours of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> towards <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Were men throughly Baptized into the Spirit of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (which are ſo lively pourtrayed by the Apoſtles St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> that one might well be enamoured of the very deſcription,) how certainly would all <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, law-ſuits, diſputations</hi> about unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and indeterminable points either be ſuppreſt or ſanctified, either not <hi>be</hi> or not <hi>be vexatious!</hi> Not to ſpeak of the <hi>oppreſſion</hi> done by over-reaching, ſtealing, lying, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs-bearing, ſlanderous detrectations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſuggeſtions, and malignant diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doubtfull ſuſpicions, (by which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly poor men oppreſs the rich;) all which true Religion abhorrs: There is a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that goes uncontrolled in the World, which is, by the cruel <hi>engroſſings</hi> and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>inſatiable tradings</hi> of richer men. What theſe are <hi>intentionally</hi> I will not ſay, but that they are really and <hi>eventually</hi> as great oppreſſions, as thoſe inhumane depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ſqueezing exactions, which are ſo much inveighed againſt, I doubt not. But be they what they will, or be they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed how they will, I am confident that this Divine principle that powerfully ſprings up into everlaſting life, would mightily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the world in this reſpect; in that it would moderate mens deſires of corruptible
<pb facs="tcp:103119:15"/> riches, forbid them to ſeek the things of this world any more or any otherwiſe than in conſiſtency with, and ſubſerviency to their primary and moſt diligent ſeeking of the Kingdom of God: it would make men ſeek the wealth of others even as their own, and make private advantages ſtoop to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good. I do verily believe that if there were none but good men in <hi>England,</hi> there would be no poor men there. Civil Laws may provide for the maintenance of the poor; but the Law of Divine love, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Religion, if it were univerſally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, would make men ſo nobly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of earthly accommodations, that there would ſoon be room enough for all men to thrive into a ſufficient ſtature; and then being ſo grown, they would covet no more.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Law-ſuits</hi> (if there were any) men would ſeek the advancement of <hi>truth,</hi> and not of their own <hi>cauſe</hi> and intereſt diſtinct from it.</p>
            <p>And oh how excellently would it ſtill the noiſe of <hi>axes</hi> and <hi>hammers</hi> about the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God! It would take men off from vain ſpeculations and much eagerneſs about unneceſſary opinions; by imploying them in more ſubſtantial and important ſtudies. The very being of Religion in the ſoul would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed decide a world of controverſies, which the Schools have long laboured in vain to determine. For I reckon that theſe <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical</hi> wars, (fitly called <hi>Polemicks,</hi>) like
<pb facs="tcp:103119:15"/> thoſe civil diſſenſions ſpoken of by the Apoſtle<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>James,</hi> do for the moſt part ſpring from mens luſts that war in their members; ſuch as <hi>pride, curioſity, laſciviency of wit, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and unſubduedneſs of underſtanding,</hi> and the like. I have obſerved with great grief, how the ſpirits of many men, I had almoſt ſaid ſects of men, run out wholly into diſputes about <hi>Ceremonies pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> about <hi>Church-Government,</hi> about what is <hi>orthodox</hi> and what is <hi>heterodox,</hi> about the <hi>true</hi> and the <hi>falſe Church</hi> (which commonly they judge by ſomething external, and indeed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the eſſence of a true Church;) and hereabout is their zeal, their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and their very prayers themſelves moſtly beſtowed. Who can doubt but that Religion in the power of it would find men ſomething elſe to do; yea and if it could not perfectly determine theſe niceties, yet it would much heal our diſſentions about them, and bring tears to quench the ſtrange and unnatural heats that are amongſt us, and cauſe ſuch dreadfull inflammations in our bowels.</p>
            <p>But it may ſeem that there is ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enmity and irreconcilable feud betwixt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that nothing, no not Religion it ſelf can heal it. And truly if we ſuppoſe that it is <hi>Religion</hi> that engages both parties in this enmity, I think it will prove incurable; But God forbid that this pure off-ſpring of Heaven ſhould be ſo blaſpheamed! It is not <hi>Religion,</hi> but indeed
<pb facs="tcp:103119:16"/> the want of it that begets this implacable animoſity, whatever is pretended. <hi>Cruel</hi> Religion, <hi>Bloody</hi> Religion, <hi>Selfiſh</hi> Religion, <hi>Envious</hi> and <hi>Revengeful</hi> Religion! Who can chooſe but cry out of the blaſphemy of this contradiction at the very firſt hearing? Nay I dare affirm it without haeſitation, that the more <hi>Religious</hi> any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Papiſt is,</hi> the more abhorrent he is from <hi>brutiſh</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſs, <hi>wicked</hi> Revenge, and <hi>deviliſh</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> judges the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Hereticks</hi> are not fit to live; and why? Not becauſe they live not well, but becauſe they cannot think and believe as they do. And is this the genuine product of true Religion? Nothing leſs. For a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ruling over mens Conſciences, and of ſubjecting the faith of others to themſelves, is certainly competible to a meer natural man, nay to the Devil himſelf, who is as lordly, cruel, and imperious as any other. The <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> on the other hand, are (I doubt) generally more offended at the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for their perſecutions of them, than for their real perſecuting and Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt afreſh by their ſins; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, do rather <hi>write</hi> and <hi>fight</hi> againſt them, than either <hi>pitty</hi> or <hi>pray</hi> for them. I hope there are as many well-ſpirited Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt proportionably, as in any Church upon earth; and yet I fear there are far more that could wiſh the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts out of <hi>this world,</hi> than that earneſtly deſire that they might be fitted for, and
<pb facs="tcp:103119:16"/> ſo counted worthy of a <hi>better.</hi> And doth this ſpring from a <hi>Religious</hi> principle think ye, or a <hi>ſelfiſh?</hi> Doth it not agree well to the animal life, and natural ſelf to be tender of its own intereſt and concernments, to wiſh well to its own ſafety to defend it ſelf from violence? May I not allude to our Saviours words, and ſay <hi>If ye hate them that hate you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 46.</note> 
               <hi>how can that be accounted Religious? Do not even the Publicans the ſame?</hi> I doubt we know not ſufficiently what ſpirit we ſhould be of. The power of Religion rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in the ſoul would mold us into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of temper; it would teach us as well to love and pitty and pray for <hi>Papiſts,</hi>

And therefore, whatever are the Ranting and
<pb facs="tcp:103119:17"/> Wrathful ſtrains of ſome mens Devotions, I beſeech the Reader to endeavour with me, that <hi>Charity</hi> towards mens ſouls may go along in conjunction with <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>piety</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, when we preſent our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of his grace: And ſo I am confident it will, if we pray ſincerely to this purpoſe, viz. <hi>That God would cauſe the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the wicked to come to an end, that he would conſume the Antichriſt but Convert the Papiſt, and make the wonderers after the beaſt to become followers of the Lamb!</hi> I doubt there are many, that think they can never be too liberal in wiſhing ill to the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nay they count it a notable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> I had almoſt ſaid an <hi>evidence of grace,</hi> to be very raging and invective againſt them. Alas, how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do we bewray our ſelves in ſo doing, to be nothing leſs, than what we pretend to by doing it! For are not we our ſelves herein <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> whileſt we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their cruelties, our own ſouls in the very act boyling over with Revengefull and ſcalding affections? If we do indeed abhor their cruelty becauſe it is contrary to the holy precepts of the Goſpel, and the true King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, we ought to be as jealous at the ſame time leſt any thing like unto it ſhould be found in our ſelves: otherwiſe are we not carnal? For meer nature, as I have often ſaid, will abhor any thing that is contrary to it ſelf, and will not willingly
<pb facs="tcp:103119:18"/> ſuffer its delicate intereſt to be toucht. The Apoſtle tells us that no man ſpeaking by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt, calleth Chriſt accurſed;</hi>

But at preſent, let me in general commend to you this deſcription made by our Saviour of true <hi>Religion,</hi> as the <hi>Rule</hi> whereby I do earneſtly entreat you faithfully to examine <hi>your ſelves,</hi> your <hi>actions, affections, zeal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, profeſſions, performances.</hi> Let me ſpeak freely, All <hi>pomp of worſhip,</hi> all <hi>speculative knowledge</hi> (though never ſo <hi>Orthodox</hi>) is as dear to the <hi>animal</hi> life as the <hi>divine:</hi> and all <hi>external modells of devotion, ſubmiſs confeſſions, devout hymns, pathetical prayers, raptures of joy, much zeal to reform indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in worſhip or ſuperſtitions, a fierce raging againſt the political Antichriſt</hi> do as well
<pb facs="tcp:103119:21"/> agree to a <hi>natural</hi> man as a <hi>spiritual,</hi> and may be as fairly acted over to ſee to, by a meer <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> carnal principle, as by that which is truly <hi>divine.</hi> When <hi>Diogenes</hi> trampled upon <hi>Plato's</hi> ſtately bed, ſaying <hi>calco Platonis faſtum;</hi> it was anſwered him very ſharply, <hi>ſed majore faſtu,</hi> he was prouder in <hi>treading</hi> upon it than <hi>Plato</hi> was in <hi>lying</hi> upon it. I doubt it may be applyed too truly to a great deal of that <hi>cynical</hi> and <hi>ſcornful</hi> zeal, that is in the world at this day; men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieur</hi> of <hi>Antichriſtian Prelates,</hi> with a <hi>pride</hi> no whit inferiour to theirs whom they thus decry. However it is plain, that thoſe things which are imitable by a <hi>ſenſual</hi> heart, and indeed performable by the meer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of an <hi>exalted fancy,</hi> are not to be reſted in by a ſincere Chriſtian. Read over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you <hi>the fruits of the spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22. &amp;c. 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7.</note> recorded by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> and eſtimate your ſelves by them: Theſe things are utterly incompetible to the meer <hi>animal man:</hi> All the natural men and Devils in the world cannot be <hi>humble, meek, ſelf-denying, patient, charitable, lovers of God more than of themſelves,</hi> or, <hi>of their enemies as themſelves.</hi> Would you judge rightly of the goodneſs of any <hi>opinion?</hi> then value it by the tendency that is in it to advance the life of God: particularly judge of the <hi>mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenarian</hi> opinion, which begins to be ſo much hugged in the world. Concerning which I will only ſay thus much at preſent: that in
<pb facs="tcp:103119:21"/> the common notion of it, as it promiſes a ſtate of much <hi>eaſe, liberty, power, prosperity,</hi> and <hi>freedom from all perſecutions and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> it is as gratefull to the <hi>fleſhly</hi> palate, and will be as gladly embraced by the meer <hi>animal</hi> man, as by the greateſt <hi>Saint</hi> upon earth. And therefore ſuppoſing it to be true, yet I cannot but wonder how it comes to adminiſter ſo much ſatisfaction, and afford ſuch a marvellous relliſh to minds divinely princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pled, as many ſeem to taſte in it. By this ſame tendency to advance the divine life in your ſouls, judge alſo of all your <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, riches, honours, liberties, friends, health, children,</hi> &amp;c. and value them, if it be poſſible, <hi>only</hi> under this conſideration. But to haſten to an end, I will endeavour to ſet on this general exhortation by two or three weighty conſiderations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is utterly impoſſible that any <hi>ſpeculation, opinion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, enjoyment, ornament, performance,</hi> or any other thing but the <hi>transformation</hi> of the mind into the very image and nature of God, ſhould ever be able to <hi>perfect</hi> our ſouls, or <hi>commend us unto God.</hi> They cannot <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> our ſouls, as being moſt of them <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,</hi> and all of them <hi>inferiour</hi> to it. They cannot <hi>commend</hi> a man to God, who loves us, and whom we ſo far know and love, as we partake of his nature, and reſemble him: This is the <hi>love</hi> of God, this is the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, and this is really the ſouls <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with him, and nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The advancement of the divine
<pb facs="tcp:103119:22"/> life is that which <hi>God mainly deſigns in the world.</hi> I need inſtance but in two things: <hi>firſt,</hi> the ſending of his own ſon into the<note place="margin">1 John 3. 5. 8.</note> world for this very end and purpoſe, <hi>that he might take away our ſins,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle <hi>John;</hi> and again <hi>that he might deſtroy the works of the devil;</hi> and again ſayes the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, That he might redeem us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works. Secondly,</hi> It appears that this is the grand deſign of God in the world, in as much as he doth not deliver his faithfull ſervants out of their afflictions and tribulations: which he would not fail to do, did he not intend them a greater good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and deſign to lead them on, and raiſe them up to a <hi>higher life.</hi> Now what can more ennoble theſe ſouls of ours, than to live upon the ſame deſign with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p>And now (<hi>Reader</hi>) I commend thee to the bleſſing of God, in the peruſal of this ſmall tract: which I have compoſed, and now expoſed, under a ſenſe of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obligation, that lyes upon every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be active in his ſphear for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the name and honour of God, and to render his life as uſefull as he may: <hi>more particularly,</hi> under a ſenſe of my own deficiency in ſeveral accompliſhments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by others are better fitted to ſerve their generation: and <hi>eſpecially,</hi> under a ſenſe of the peculiar engagement that lyeth upon <hi>me,</hi> to dedicate my life entirely to his

            <p>THis Chapter contains an excellent, profitable, familiar diſcourſe of the bleſſed Saviour of the World, into
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103119:25"/> whoſe Lips grace was poured, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 2. and he ceaſed not to pour it out again: That which is ſaid of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> Prov. 15. 7. is fully verified of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> it ſelf, His Lips diſperſed Knowledge. A poor Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> comes to draw Water, and our Saviour takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from the Water, to inſtruct her in the great and excellent Doctrines of the Kingdom of Heaven. Oh the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable zeal for God, and compaſſion for Sonls, which dwelt in that Divine Breaſt! And Oh the wonderful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Councels of an all-wiſe God! He ordains <hi>Saul</hi>'s ſeeking of Aſſes to be the means of his finding a Kingdom upon Earth; and this poor Woman's ſeeking of Water, to be an occaſion of her finding the way to the Kingdom of Heaven: She comes to the <hi>Well of Jaceb,</hi> and behold ſhe meets with the <hi>God of Jacob</hi> there. The Occaſion, Paſſages, and Iſſue of this Diſcourſe, would each afford many good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Obſervations: But I think none more than this verſe that I have pitch'd upon; in which the myſtery of Goſpel-Grace is rarely unfolded, and true
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103119:25"/> Chriſtian Religion is excellently deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. For ſo I underſtand our Saviour, not as ſpeaking of Faith or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or any other particular Grace, but of Grace in general, of the holy Spirit of God, that is, the Gifts and Graces of it, of true Godlineſs, or if you will, of Chriſtian <hi>Religion;</hi> for that word I ſhall chooſe to retain throughout my Diſcourſe, as being moſt intelligible and comprehenſive.</p>
            <p>In which words we find true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion unfolded in the <hi>original, nature, properties, conſequent,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of it.

            <p>Yet further, It pleaſed God in his infinite Wiſdom and Mercy, to chalk out the way of Life and Peace in the holy Scriptures, and therein to unlock the ſecrets of Salvation to ſucceeding generations. Herein he hath plainly laid down the terms of the Covenant of Peace, which was made in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and given Precepts and Promiſes for the direction and encouragement of as many as will enquire into the ſame.

God hath been pleaſed to commit theſe Records into the hands of his Church, and therein to his Miniſters, whom he hath appointed, called, qualified, inſtructed for the opening, explaining, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; applying of them: ſo that they are called <hi>Scribes inſtructed unto the Kingdom of God, and ſtewards of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,</hi> Stewards over the houſhold of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give unto every one his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>Theſe things hath God done for us, <hi>from without us;</hi> he hath ſet up a light, chalk'd out our way, and appointed us Guides. To which I might adde the many inticements and motives, which we call Mercies or Comforts of this

               </gap>ightments of Judgements and Afflictions, which God hath added to the Promiſes &amp; Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his Word, to bring us into the way of Life. But all theſe are too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, too weak of themſelves to bring back a ſtragling Soul, or to produce a living Principle of true Religion in it. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is the Author of Religion <hi>from within.</hi> He doth not only reveal himſelf and his Son <hi>to</hi> the Soul, but <hi>in</hi> it; he doth not only make diſcoveries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vely impreſſions upon it; he doth not only appoint, and point out the way of Life, but breathes in the breath of Life. He hath not only provided a Saviour, a Redeemer, but he alſo draws the Soul unto him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. He hath not only appointed <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers,</hi> but he himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnates their Word, and cloaths their Doctrine with his own Power, uſing their Miniſtry as an Inſtrument whereby to teach; ſo that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are ſaid to be <hi>all taught of God, John</hi> 6. 45. Miniſters can only diſcover and as it were enlighten the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103119:29"/> 
               <hi>Object,</hi> but God enlightens the <hi>faculty,</hi> he gives the ſeeing Eye, and does actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enable it to diſcern. Therefore the work of converting a Soul is ſtill aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God in Scripture; he begets us again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. he draws the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can run after him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. Chriſt apprehends the Soul, lays pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful bold of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. God gives a heart of fleſh, a new heart, he cauſes men to walk in his ſtatutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. He puts his Law into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and writes it in their hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. To which I might adde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Quotations of the ſame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
            <p>But yet methinks we are not come to a perfect diſcovery of Religions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Off-ſpring of God in the minds of men. For it is God who enlightneth the faculty as to the learning of all other things alſo; he teacheth the <hi>Grammar</hi> and the <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> as well as the <hi>Divinity;</hi> he inſtructeth even the Husbandman to diſcretion in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Husbandry, and teaches him to plow, and ſow, and threſh, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 28. 26. Not only the gift of Divine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103119:29"/> Knowledge, but indeed <hi>every good gift</hi> cometh from the Father of Lights, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. God doth from within give that capacity, illumination of the faculty, ingenuity, whereby we comprehend the myſteries of Nature, as well as of Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Therefore we may conceive of the Original of Religion in a more inward and ſpiritual manner ſtill. It is not ſo much given of God, as it ſelf is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God in the Soul; as the Soul is not ſo properly ſaid to give, as to be the Life of Man. As the conjunction of the Soul with the Body, is the Life of the Body; ſo verily the Life of the Soul ſtands in its conjunction with God by a ſpiritual union of Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. God doth not enlighten mens minds as the Sun enlightens the World, by ſhining <hi>unto</hi> them, and round about them, but by ſhining <hi>into</hi> them, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the faculty, as I ſaid before; yea, which ſeems to be ſomewhat more, by ſhining in their hearts, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle phraſeth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. He ſets up a Candle, which is his own Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Soul; ſo that the Soul ſees God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103119:30"/> in his own Light, and loves him with the Love that he hath ſhed abroad in it; and Religion is no other than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of that Divine Image, Life, and Light, and Love, which from God are ſtamped and imprinted upon the Souls of true Chriſtians. God is ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Soul, but it is not as the Sun enlightens, you ſee; ſo he draws the Soul too, but not <hi>ab extra</hi> only, as one man draweth another with a Cord, (as <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> draws men up to Heaven by a Chain, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Diſciples by a Lock of Hair) but he draws the Soul, as the Sun draws up Earthly Vapours, by infuſing its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power into them; or as the Loadſtone draws the Iron, by the powerful inſinuations of his grace. God doth not ſo much communicate himſelf to the Soul by way of <hi>Diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>overy,</hi> as by way of <hi>Impreſſion,</hi> as I ſaid before; and indeed not ſo much by <hi>impreſſion</hi> neither, as by a myſtical and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way of <hi>implantation.</hi> Religion is not ſo much ſomething <hi>from God,</hi> as ſomething <hi>of God</hi> in the Minds of good Men; for ſo the Scripture allows us to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103119:30"/> ſpeak: It is therefore called his <hi>Image, Col.</hi> 3. 10. and good men are ſaid to <hi>live according to God in the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 6. But as if that were not high enough, it is not only called his Image, but even a participation of his Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. ſomething of Chriſt in the Soul, an infant-Chriſt, as one calls it, alluding to the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. where the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, is called <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf,—<hi>

An immortal Soul doth more reſemble the Divine Nature, than any other created Being; but Religion in the Soul is a thouſand times more divine than the Soul it ſelf. The material World is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a darker Repreſentation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs; it is as it were the <hi>footſteps</hi> of God:

Value your ſelves by your ſouls, and not by your bodies, eſtates, friends, or any outward accompliſhments, as moſt men do: But that is not enough; (if men reſt there, they may make an idoll of the faireſt of Gods creatures, even their own ſouls,) therefore value your ſouls themſelves by what they have of God in them.

All the

Oh labour to view God and his Divine perfections in your own ſouls, in thoſe copies and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of them which his holy ſpirit draws upon the hearts of all godly men.

            <p>There have been of old a great number of Philoſophical men, who being raiſed up above the ſpeculation of their own ſouls, (which is the <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> life,) unto a contemplation of a Deity; and being purged by a lower kind of vertue and moral goodneſs,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103119:37"/> from the pollutions that are in this world through luſt, did yet ultimately ſettle into themſelves, and their own ſelf-love.

Theſe men whileſt they pretend to high attainments, do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a low and moſt ignoble ſpirit: To faſten and feed upon any thing in the Creature, is the part of a low and degenerate ſpirit; on the other hand it is the greateſt perfection of the Creature, not to be its own, not to be any thing in it ſelf, or any way diſtinct from the bleſſed God, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fountain of light and grace. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> is all along in a different ſtrain, as in 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> I told you before what a fair and honourable character the Holy Ghoſt hath given of holy <hi>David,</hi> a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods own heart: now you may alſo find a deſcription of theſe men too in Scripture, not much differing from the other in <hi>phraſe,</hi> but very much in <hi>ſenſe;</hi> it is the ſame that is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103119:38"/> given of the proud Prince of <hi>Tyrus, Ezek.</hi> 28. 2. They ſet their heart as the heart of God. But we, if we do indeed partake of the Divine Nature, ſhall not dare to take any part of the Divine Glory; if we conform to Gods Image, we ſhall not ſet up our own. This ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorying in the predominancy of it is utterly inconſiſtent with true Religion, as Fire is with Water: For Religion is nothing elſe but the ſhinings forth of God into the Soul, the reflection of a beauty and glory which God hath put upon it. Give all therefore unto God; for whatſoever is kept back, is ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly purloined from him: Glory we in the fulneſs of God alone, and in ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penury and nothingneſs. The whole of Religion is of God: Do we ſee and diſcern the great things of God? It is by that light that God hath ſet up in us; according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. The things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God:</hi> That love whereby we love him, he firſt ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in our hearts: If our Souls be beautiful, it is with his brightneſs, the beauty and glory of eſſential Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103119:39"/> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 12.—Partakers of his holineſs:</hi> If we be really and truly full, we receive it of his fulneſs, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 19.—filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> In a word, if we be in any God-like diſpoſitions like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, it is by his ſpreading of his image in us and over us. By all which it appears to be a thing not only wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unwarrantable, but utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a godly Soul to exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt God, for grace to advance it ſelf againſt divine glory; for grace is nothing elſe but a communication of divine glory; and God is then glorified, when the Soul in holy and gracious diſpoſitions becomes like unto him. How is it poſſible that grace ſhould be a ſhadow to obſcure divine glory, when it ſelf is nothing elſe, as it comes from God, but a <hi>Beam</hi> of glory, and as it is found in the Creature, may properly be called a <hi>reflection</hi> of it. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, Be ye perſwaded that a man hath ſo much of God, as he hath of Humility, and Self denial, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothingneſs, and no more; He is ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103119:39"/> far of God, as he loves Him, honours Him, imitates H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. By this diſcovery of the Original of Religion, we come to underſtand the Original of Sin and Wickedneſs. And here, according to the method wherein I ſpoke of the Original of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I might ſhew you how the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Sin <hi>from without,</hi> is of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that firſt uſher'd it into the World, and ceaſeth not to tempt men to it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; as alſo of men, who are his inſtruments; and that it does in a ſenſe ſpring from many occaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. But theſe things are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſaid to be the cauſes of Sin. The inward cauſe is the corrupt heart of man, that unclean ſpirit, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh nature, which is indeed the worſt and moſt pernicious Devil in the world to Man. It is an old ſaying, <hi>Homo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Daemon;</hi> One Man is a Devil to another: which though it be in ſome ſenſe true; yet it is more proper to ſay, <hi>Homo ſibi Daemon;</hi> Man is a Devil to himſelf; taking the ſpirit and principle of Apoſtacy, that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103119:40"/> nature for the Devil, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed doth beſt deſerve that name. But yet if we enquire more ſtrictly into the original and nature of this Monſter, we ſhall beſt know what to ſay of it, and how to deſcribe it, by what we have heard of Religion. Sin then, to ſpeak properly, is nothing elſe but a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from a holy ſtate, an apoſtacy from a holy God. Religion is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of God, and ſin is a ſtragling off from him. Therefore it is wont to be defined by Negatives, a departure from God, a forſaking of him, a living in the World without him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Souls falling off from God, does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the general nature of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n; but then as it ſinks into it ſelf, or ſettles upon the World, and faſtens upon the Creature, or any thing therein; ſo it becomes ſpecified, and is called Pride, Covetouſneſs, Ambition, and by many other names. All Souls are the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of God, were originally formed into his image and likeneſs, and when they expreſs the purity and holineſs of the Divine Nature, in being perfect as God is perfect, then are they called the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103119:40"/> Children of God: But thoſe impure Spirits that do lapſe and ſlide from God, may be ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to implant themſelves into a o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtock by their own low and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lives, and are no more owned for the Children of God, but are of their father the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 10. 44. By which you may underſtand the low and baſe original of Sin: Nothing can be ſo vile as that which, to ſpeak properly, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a perfect falling off from glory it ſelf. By this you may alſo (by the way) take notice of the miſerable condition of unholy Souls. We need not call for Fire and Brimſtone to paint out the wretched ſtate of ſinful Souls. Sin it ſelf is Hell and Death, and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Soul, as being a departure from Goodneſs and Holineſs it ſelf; I mean from God, in conjunction with whom the Happineſs, and Bleſſedneſs, and Heaven of a Soul doth conſiſt. Avoid it therefore as you would avoid being miſerable.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103119:42"/> Idols will I cleanſe you:</hi> for ordinary elementary Water cannot cleanſe men from Idols. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo puts it out of doubt, whoſe Prophecy, together with the interpretation of it, we find both in one verſe, <hi>Iſa. 44. 3. I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thine Off-ſpring.</hi> By the ſame Ceremony the Goſpel-Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhadows out the ſame Myſtery, in the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and by the ſame phraſe, our Saviour <hi>offers</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> the ſame Grace, <hi>Joh. 7. 37. If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink:</hi> and his Apoſtles after him, who in alluſion to Water, call this Grace the <hi>waſhing of Regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. To which I might adde 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Texts, if it needed.</p>
            <p>Now as the grace of God is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Fire,</hi> becauſe of its refining na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſuming the droſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of Luſt in the Soul; and to other things for other reaſons; ſo is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Water, eſpecially for thoſe two properties, <hi>viz. Cleanſing</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103119:43"/> 
               <hi>quenching.</hi> For obſerve this by the way, that it is a very injurious thing to the holy Ghoſt, to preſs the Metaphors which he uſeth in Scripture, further than they do naturally &amp; freely ſerve. Neither are we to ſtick in the letter of the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> but to attend unto the ſcope of it. If we tenaciouſly adhere to the phraſe, wanton wits will be ready to quarrel with abſurdities, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares run into ſtrange blaſphemies: They will cry out preſently, How can Fire waſh, when they read that of the Prophet. <hi>Iſa. 4. 4. The Lord will waſh away the filth of the Daughter of Sion, by the Spirit of Burning?</hi> But who art thou, O man, that wilt teach him to ſpeak, who formed the Tongue? The Spirit of God intends the vertue and property of things when he names them, and that we muſt mainly <hi>attend</hi> to.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, by the phraſe <hi>Water,</hi> is the <hi>Cleanſing</hi> nature of Religion commended to us: It is the undefiling of the Soul, which Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath polluted: Sin is oft deſcribed in Scripture by <hi>filthineſs, loathſomneſs,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103119:43"/> abomination, uncleanneſs,</hi> a <hi>ſpot,</hi> a <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,</hi> a <hi>ſtain,</hi> a <hi>pollution;</hi> which indeed is a moſt proper deſcription of it. The ſpots of Leproſie, and the ſcurff of the fowleſt ſcurvy are beauty ſpots in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of it: <hi>Job</hi> upon the Dunghil, furniſhed cap-a-pe with ſcabs and boils, was not half ſo loathſome as goodly <hi>Abſalom,</hi> in whoſe Body <hi>there was no blemiſh from the ſole of his foot to the crown of his head;</hi> but his Soul was ſtained with the <hi>ſanguine ſpots</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and revenge, and feſtred with the loathſome <hi>Carbuncle</hi> and <hi>Tumour</hi> of Ambition. <hi>Lazarus</hi> lying at the gates full of raw and running ſores, was a far more lovely object in the pure Eyes of God, than dame <hi>Jezabel</hi> looking out at the window, adorned with ſpots and paints. If the beſt of a godly man that he hath of his own, even his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, be as a filthy rag, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 6. Whence ſhall we borrow a phraſe ſoul enough to deſcribe the worſt of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, even his wickedneſs; I need ſay no more of it, I can ſay no worſe of it, than to tell you it is ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God, who is the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103119:44"/> of Light, who is Beauty, and Brightneſs, and Glory it ſelf; or to give it you in the Apoſtle's phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. a falling ſhort of the glory of God. Which hath made me many times to wonder, and almoſt ready to cry out with the Prophet, <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens at this,</hi> when I have ſeen poor, ignorant, wicked, and prophane Wretches, paſſing by a perſon or a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily viſited with ſome loathſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, in a mixture of fear and diſdain, ſtopping their Noſes, and haſtning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; when their own Souls have been more vile than the dung upon the Earth, ſpotted with Ignorance and Atheiſm, ſwollen with the riſings of Pride and Self-will, and contempt of God and his holy Image. This might well be a matter of wonder to any man, till he conſider with himſelf, that one part of theſe mens uncleanneſs, is that very blindneſs which keeps them from diſcerning it: I ſpeak principally of the defilement of the Soul; though indeed the ſame do pollute the whole Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: Every action ſpringing from ſuch an unclean Heart, thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103119:44"/> filthy; even as <hi>Moſes</hi> his hand, put into his boſome became leprous, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. or rather as one that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by a dead body, defileth all that he toucheth, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>Now Religion is the cleanſing of this unclean ſpirit and converſation; ſo that though the Soul were formerly as filthy &amp; odious as <hi>Augeus</hi> his Stable, when once thoſe living Waters flow into it, and thorow it from the pure Fountain of Grace and Holineſs, the Spirit of our God, one may ſay of it as the Apoſtle of his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>Such were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. The Soul that before was white as <hi>leproſie,</hi> is now white as <hi>Wool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iſa.</hi> 1. 18. the Soul that before was like <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>hand,</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous as ſnow, is now like <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Heart,</hi> white as ſnow, yea, and whiter too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 7. Oh what a beauty and glory is upon that godly Soul that ſhines with the image and brightneſs of God upon it! <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was not beautiful like ſuch a Soul; nay, I dare ſay, the ſplendor of the Sun in its greateſt ſtrength and altitude, is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103119:45"/> a miſerable glimmering, if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>Day-Star</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> that even in this Life ariſes in the heart, or if you will in the Prophets ſtile, the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which ariſeth with healing in his wings, upon them that fear the Name of God. To ſpeak without a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> the godly Soul ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entertained into its ſelf the pure effluxes of Divine Light and Love, breathes after nothing more than to ſee more familiarly, and love more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, its <hi>inclinations</hi> are pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, its <hi>motions</hi> ſpiritual and powerful, its <hi>delights</hi> high and heavenly; it may be ſaid to reſt in its love, and yet it may be ſaid that love will not ſuffer it to reſt, but is ſtill carrying it out into a more intimate union with its beloved object. What is ſaid of the <hi>Oyntment</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Name, Cant.</hi> 1. 3. is true of the <hi>Water</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is poured forth, therefore do the Virgins love him: Religion begets a chaſte and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-love in the Soul towards that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God that begot it, it bathes it ſelf in the Fountain that produc'd it, and ſuns it ſelf perpetually in the warm
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103119:45"/> beams that firſt hatch'd it. Religion iſſues from God himſelf, and is ever iſſuing out towards God alone, paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately breathing with the holy Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? In Earth there is none that I deſire beſide thee!</hi> The Soul that formerly may be ſaid to have lain among the Pots, by reaſon of its filthineſs, is now as the wings of a Dove covered with ſilver, and her Feathers with yellow gold: the Soul that formerly may be ſaid to have ſitten down by the fleſh pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in regard of its ſenſual and earthly Loves, being redeemed by the almighty grace of God, is upon its way to the holy Land, haſtning to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not earthly but heavenly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. This pure Principle being put into the Soul, puts it upon holy Studies, indites holy Meditations, directs it to high and noble ends, and makes all its embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be pure and chaſte, labouring to compaſs God himſelf, which before were adulterous &amp; idolatrous, free for ſin, and ſelf, and the world, to lodge and lie down in. In a word, this Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Heaven, this Kings Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103119:46"/> the godly Soul, is <hi>all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> yea, and outwardly too, ſhe is cloathed with wrought gold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. Her faith within, is more precious than gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. and her Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion curiouſly made up of an Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery of good Works, ſome of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ety, ſome of Charity, ſome of Sobriety, but all of Purity, ſhineth with more noble and excellent ſplendor, than the high Prieſts Garments and Breſt-plate ſpangled with ſuch variety of precious Stones. This precious Oyntment, this holy <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20. is as diffuſive of it ſelf and ten thouſand times more fragrant than that of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſo much commended in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. that ran down from his head upon his beard, and from thence upon the skirts of his garment. <hi>Not my feet only, but my hands and my head, Lord;</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter, John</hi> 13. Not well knowing what he ſaid; but the Soul that is truly ſenſible of the excellent purity which is cauſed by Divine Waſhings, longs to have the whole man, the whole Life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made partaker of it, and cries, Lord not my head only, not my heart only,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103119:46"/> but my hands and my feet alſo, make me wholly pure as God is pure. In a word then, true Religion is the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Soul, and all the powers of it, ſo that whereas Murderers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lodged in it, now Righteouſneſs; the <hi>Den of Thieves,</hi> thieviſh Luſts and Loves, and Intereſts, and Ends, which formerly ſtole away the Soul from God its right Owner, is now become a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> fit for the great King to dwell, and live, and reign in: And the whole Converſation is turned from its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vanity, worldlineſs, and iniquity, and is continually employed about things that are true, honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely, and of good report, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the phraſe <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> nature of Religion is commended to us. God hath indued the immortal Soul with a reſtleſs appetite and raging thirſt after ſome chief Good, which the heart of every man is continually gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after, and catching at, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed few find it, becauſe they ſeek it where it is not to be found. If we ſpeak properly, it is not gold, or ſilver, or popular applauſe, which the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103119:47"/> or ambitious mind doth ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aim at, but ſome chief good, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſufficiency, and ſatisfaction in theſe things: wherein they are more guilty of Blaſphemy than Atheiſm: for it is clear that they do not deny a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good, (for that which men do chiefly and ultimately aim at, is their God, be it what it will) but they do verily blaſpheme the true God, when they place their happineſs there where it is not to be found, and attribute that fulneſs and ſufficiency to ſomething elſe beſides the living God. Sin hath not deſtroyed the nature and capacity of the rational Soul, but hath diverted the mind from its adequate object, and hath ſunk it into the Creature, where it wanders hither and thither, like a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed man, from one Den and Cave to another, but is ſecure no where. A wicked man, who is looſed from his centre by ſin, and departed from the Fountain of his Life, flies low in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and flutters perpetually about the Earth, and earthly Objects, but can find no more reſt for the foot of his Soul, than <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove could find for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103119:47"/> the ſole of her foot. Now Religion is the hand that pulls this wandring Bird into her own Ark from whence ſhe was departed; it ſettles the Soul upon its proper centre, and quenches its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thirſt after happineſs. And for this reaſon it is called Water in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as appears from <hi>Iſa. 58. 11. The Lord ſhall ſatisfie thy Soul in drought;</hi> and of <hi>Iſa. 45. 3. I will pour Water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground;</hi> compared with <hi>John 7. 37. Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink.</hi> Religion is a taſte of infinite Goodneſs which quenches the Souls thirſt after all other created and finite Good; even as that taſte which honeſt <hi>Nathaniel</hi> had of Chriſts Divinity, took him off from the expectation of any Meſſiah to come, and made him cry out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael,</hi> Joh. 1. 49. And every religious Soul hath ſuch a taſte of God even in this life, which though it do not perfectly fill him, yet doth perfectly aſſure him where all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells. But of this I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103119:48"/> to diſcourſe more largely, when I come to treat of the <hi>conſequent</hi> of true Religion.</p>
            <p>I proceed therefore to the ſecond phraſe whereby our Saviour deſcribes the nature of true Religion, It is a <hi>Well,</hi> a Fountain in the Soul,—<hi>Shall be in him a Well of Water.</hi> From which phraſe, to wave niceties, I ſhall only obſerve,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Religion is a Principle in the Souls of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Water that Chriſt pours into the Soul, is not like the Water that he pours upon our Streets, that waſhes them, and runs away; but it becomes a cleanſing Principle within the Soul it ſelf; every drop from God becomes a Fountain in man. Not as if man had a kind of <gap reason="foreign">

God hath indeed given this to his natural Son, his only begotten Son, to have <hi>life in himſelf,</hi> Joh. 5. 26. but not to any of his adopted ones. If you ask me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man in his natural capacity, I am ſo far
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103119:48"/> quickning power, a principle of life in himſelf, that I muſt needs aſſert the contrary with the Apoſtle, That he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1. ſo far from thinking that he hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Well of Water, that I muſt call him, with the Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 44. thirſty and dry ground.</hi> As for the Regenerate man, I will not enter into that deep controverſie concerning the co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans Will with the Spirit of God, and its ſubordination to that in all gracious acts, or what a kind of cauſe of them this renewed will of man may be ſafely called, only I will affirm, That Repenting and Believing, are properly mans acts, and yet they are performed by Gods power; firſt Chriſt muſt give this Water, ere it can be a Well of Water in the Soul: Which is enough, I ſuppoſe to clear me from ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with either of thoſe parties, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that aſcribe to God that which he cannot do, or thoſe that aſcribe to Free-will that which God alone can do. But I fear nothing from theſe Controverſies, for that way wherein I ſhall diſcourſe of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103119:49"/> will nothing at all border upon them. This then, I affirm, That Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a living Principle in the Souls of good men: I cannot better deſcribe the nature of Religion, than to ſay it is a <hi>Nature;</hi> for ſo does the Apoſtle ſpeak, or at leaſt allows us to ſpeak, when he calls it a participation of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing but a Nature can partake of a Nature; a mans Friend may partake of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Kindneſs, but his Child only partakes of his Nature: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, begets a Nature, and ſo doth he that begets again. The Sun enlightens the World outwardly, but it does not give a Sun like nature to the things ſo enlightened; and the Rain doth moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the Earth, and refreſh it inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it does not beget the nature of Water in the Earth: But this Water that I give (ſays our Saviour) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a Well of Water in the Soul. Religion is not any thing without a Man, hanging upon him, or annext to him; neither is it every ſomething that is in a man, (as we ſhall ſee anon) but it is a Divine Principle informing and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103119:49"/> actuating the Souls of good Men, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and lively Principle, a free and flowing Principle, a ſtrong and laſting Principle, an inward and ſpiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. I muſt not ſpeak of all theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in this place, for fear of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in my diſcourſe. When I ſay Religion is a Principle, a vital Form act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul and all the powers of it, an inward nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Saith not the Scripture the ſame here, a Well or Fountain of Water? And elſewhere, a <hi>new man, the hidden man of the heart, the inward man,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24, 1 Pet. 3. 4. As the Soul is called an inward man, reſpective to the Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. ſo Religion is called an inward man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective to the Soul it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. It is a man within man. The man that is truly alive to God, hath in him not only inward parts, for ſo a dead man hath, but an inward man, an inward <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Principle.</hi> Again, It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Root,</hi> Job 19. 28. or if not there, yet plainly in <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 17. Where tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Profeſſors are ſaid to have no root in themſelves. And this is by the ſame propriety of ſpeech, whereby a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103119:50"/> wicked principle is called, <hi>A Root of bitterneſs, Heb.</hi> 12. 15. Again, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Seed, the Seed of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. where this Seed of God is called an a biding or remaining principle. In the firſt Creation God made the Trees of the earth, having their ſeed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 11. and in the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe trees of Righteouſneſs, of Gods planting, are alſo made with ſeed <hi>in</hi> themſelves, though not <hi>of</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: it is ſaid to be the Seed of God indeed, but remaining in the godly Soul. Again, it is called a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> in oppoſition to an Alms or Annuity, that laſteth but for a day or an year, as a <hi>Well</hi> of Water, in oppoſition to a <hi>Diſh</hi> of Water; and a Treaſure of the <hi>heart,</hi> in oppoſition to all outward and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 35. It is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure affording continual expences, not exhauſted, yea encreaſed by expences; wherein it exceeds all treaſures in the World. By the ſame propriety of Speech, Sin is called a treaſure too, but it is an <hi>evil treaſure,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks in that ſame place.

But I doubt many Chriſtians are alſo ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe, whilſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103119:51"/> they view the Goſpel as an Hiſtory, and an external diſpenſation; whereas the Apoſtle, when he oppoſeth it to the Law, ſeems altogether to make it an internal thing, a vital form and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeated in the minds and ſpirits of men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. The Law was an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rule or Diſpenſation, that could not give Life, though it ſhewed the way to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. but the Goſpel in the moſt proper notion of it, ſeems to be an internal impreſſion from God, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving principle whereby the Soul is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to expreſs a real conformity to God himſelf. If we conſider the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the Hiſtory of it, and as a piece of Book-Learning, it is as weak and impotent a thing as the Law was, and men may be as overly and formal in the profeſſion of this, as they were of that, which we ſee by daily ſad experience. But if we conſider the Goſpel, as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Life and Power from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Soul, producing Life where-ever it comes, then we have a clear diſtinction between the Law and the Goſpel; to which the Apoſtle ſeems to refer, when he calls the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103119:51"/> the Epiſtle of Chriſt, not written with ink, nor in Tables of Stone, but with the Spirit of the living God, in fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tables of the Heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 3 3. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which notion of the Law and Goſpel, I think we may (with a learned man of our own) come to a good underſtanding of that tormented Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 31. quoted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Heb. 10. 8. This is the Covenant that I will make I will put my Law into their minds,</hi> &amp;c. The Goſpel doth not ſo much conſiſt in <hi>verbis,</hi> as in <hi>virtute;</hi> a Divine Principle of Religion in the Soul, is the beſt Goſpel: And ſo <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> under the Law, were truly <hi>Goſpellers;</hi> and on the other hand, All carnal Chriſtians that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Goſpel only as a thing without them, are as truly <hi>legal,</hi> and as far ſhort of the Righteouſneſs of God, as ever any of the Jews were.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that Religion is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the Souls of good Men.—<hi>Shall be in him a Well of Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall here now take notice of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103119:52"/> difference between the true, and all counterfeit Religions. Religion is that pearl of great price, which few men are poſſeſſed of, though all men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, <hi>Laodicean</hi>-like, ſaying, they are rich, and need nothing, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are poor and have nothing. This then ſhall be the teſt by which at preſent we will a little try the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit pearls. True Religion is an inward nature, an inward and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle in the minds of good men, a <hi>well of water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then we muſt exclude all things that are meerly external; theſe are not it. Religion is not ſomething annex'd to the ſoul <hi>ab extra,</hi> but a new nature put into it. And here we ſhall glance at two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A godly ſoul does not find the whole of his ſoul lying without him.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does not conſiſt in external <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,</hi> though never ſo many and ſpecious. A falſe and overly Religion may ſerve to tie mens hands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their outward actions to a fair ſeemlineſs in the eyes of men: but true Religion's main dominion and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103119:52"/> power is over the ſoul, and its buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies moſtly in reforming and purging the heart, with all the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and motions thereof. It is not a battering Ram coming from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ſerving to beat down the <hi>out-works</hi> of open and viſible enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life; but enters with a ſecret and ſweet power into the ſoul it ſelf, and reduces it from its rebellious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and perſwades it willingly to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it ſelf, and all that is in it. Sin may be beaten out of the outward converſation, and yet retire and hide it ſelf in the ſecret places of the ſoul, and there bear rule as perfectly by wicked loves and luſts, as ever it did by prophane and notorious practices. A man's hands may be tied by ſome external cords caſt upon them, from viſible revenge, and yet murders may lodge in the temple of his heart, as murderers lodged in the Temple of old: mens tongues may be tied up from the foul ſin of giving fair words concerning themſelves, very ſhame may chaſtize them out of proud boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſelf-exaltings; when in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103119:53"/> mean time they ſwell in ſelf-conceit, and are not afraid to bear an unchaſte and ſinful love towards their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and adore an image of ſelf ſet up in their hearts. What a fair <hi>out-ſide</hi> the <hi>Phariſee</hi> had, himſelf will beſt deſcribe, (for indeed it is one of his properties to deſcribe himſelf) <hi>Luke 18. 11. God, I thank thee that I am not,</hi> &amp;c. but if you will have a draught of his <hi>inſide,</hi> you may beſt take it from our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Religion conſiſt in external <hi>performances,</hi> though never ſo many, and ſeemingly ſpiritual. Many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, I doubt, ſink all their Religion into a conſtant courſe of duties, and a model of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, being more ſtrangers to the life, and ſtrength, and ſweetneſs of true Religion. Thoſe things are needful and uſeful, and helpful, yea, and honourable, becauſe they have a relation and ſome tendency to God; but they are apt to become ſnares and idols to ſuperſtitious minds, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that God is ſome way gratified by theſe, and ſo they take up their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103119:53"/> reſt in them. That Religion, that only varniſhes and beautifies the outſide, tunes the Tongue to Prayer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, inſtructs and extends the Hands to Diligence and Almeſdeeds, that awes the Converſation into ſome external Righteouſneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Devotion, is here excluded, as alſo by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Much leſs can that paſs for Religion, that ſpends it ſelf about Forms, and Opinions, and Parties, and many diſputable points, which we have ſeen ſo much of in our own Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Religion that runs upon modes, and turns upon intereſts, as a door turns upon its hinges, is a poor narrow ſcant thing, and may eaſily view it ſelf at once, all together from firſt to laſt. Men may be as far from the Kingdom of Heaven in their more ſpiritual Forms, and Orthodox Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they were in their more carnal and erroneous, if they take up their reſt in them: Neither is it the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any intereſt that will denominate them religious, but the grand intereſt of their Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A godly Soul in his more inward
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103119:54"/> and ſpiritual acts, hath not his motive without him:</hi> For a man may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more inward in his motions, and yet as outward in his motives as the former. Religions acts and gracious motions are not originally and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cauſed by ſome weights hung upon the Soul either by God or men, neither by the worldly Bleſſings which God gives, nor the heavy afflictions which he ſends. The Wings by which the godly Soul flies out towards God, are not waxt to him, as the Poets feign <hi>Icarus</hi>'s to have been; but they grow out of himſelf, as the wings of an Eagle that flies ſwiftly towards Heaven: On the other ſide, a Soul may be <hi>preſs down</hi> unto humiliation under the heavy weight of Gods Judgements, that has no mind to <hi>ſtoop,</hi> no ſelf-denying or ſelf-debaſing diſpoſition in it. Thus you may ſee <hi>Jehu</hi> flying upon the Wings of Ambition and Revenge, born up by ſucceſſes in his Government; and his Predeceſſor <hi>Ahab</hi> bowing down mournfully under an heavy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The Laws, and Penalties, and Encouragements, and Obſervations of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103119:54"/> men, do ſometimes put a weight upon the Soul too, but they beget a more ſluggiſh, uneven, and unkindly motion in it. You may expect that under this head I ſhould ſpeak ſomething of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell;</hi> and truly ſo I may very pertinently, for I think they do belong to this place. If you take <hi>Heaven</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, for a ſull and glorious union to God, and fruition of him, and <hi>Hell</hi> for an eternal ſeparation and ſtragling from the Divinity, and ſuppoſe that the love of God, and the fear of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without him, be well drunk into the Soul, then verily theſe are pure and religious Principles: But if we view them as things meerly without us, and reſerved for us, and under thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon carnal notions of <hi>delectableneſs</hi> and <hi>dreadfulneſs,</hi> they are no higher nor better motives to us, than the carnal Jews had in the Wilderneſs, when they turned their Backs upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they had been in bondage, and ſet their Faces towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they hoped to find <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> Peace, Plenty and Liberty. A Soul is not carried to Heaven, as a Body is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103119:55"/> carried to the Grave, upon mens Shoulders; it is not born up by Props, whether humane or divine; nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to God in a Charior, as a man is carried to ſee his Friend: The holy fire of arden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103119:56"/> that are ſomewhat more convinced, enlightened, and affected, to imitate the very power and ſpirit of Religion, and to deceive themſelves too, as if they poſſeſt ſome true living Principle; and herein they exceed the moſt exquiſite Painters. Now this may be done by the power of a quick and raiſed Fancy; men hearing ſuch glorious things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Heaven, the City of the great King, the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out by the power of ſelf-Love, to wiſh themſelves there, being mightily taken with a conceit of the place. But how ſhall they come at it? Why they have ſeen in Books, and heard in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, of certain ſigns of Grace, and evidences of Salvation; and now they ſet their fancies on work, to find or make ſome ſuch things in themſelves. Fancy is well acquainted with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affections of Love, Fear, Joy, Grief, which are in the Soul, and having a great command over the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it can ſend them forth to raiſe up theſe Affections, even almoſt when it liſteth; and when it hath raiſed them, it is but putting to ſome thoughts of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103119:57"/> God and Heaven, and then theſe look like a handſome platform of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion drawn in the Soul; which they preſently view, and fall in love with, and think they do even taſte of the powers of the world to come, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is nothing but a ſelf-fulneſs and ſufficiency that they feed upon. Now you may know this artificial Religion by this; Theſe men can vary it, alter it, enlarge it, ſtraiten it, and new mold it at pleaſure, according to what they ſee in others, or according to what themſelves like beſt; one while acting over the <hi>Joy and Confidence</hi> of ſome Chriſtians, anon the <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Brokenneſs</hi> of others. But this fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Religion, proceeding indeed from nothing but low and carnal conceits of God and Heaven, is of a flitting and vaniſhing nature. But true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103119:57"/> and ſweetly derives it ſelf through the will and affections, which makes true Religion to be a conſiſtent and thriving principle in the Soul, as not being acted upon the ſtage of imagination, but upon the higheſt powers of the Soul it ſelf: and may be diſcerned by the <hi>evenneſs</hi> of its motions, and the <hi>immortality</hi> of its nature: for a good man though indeed he cannot go on alwayes with like ſpeed and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his way, yet is not willing at any time to be quite out of it.</p>
            <p>By this ſame nature of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may examine all thoſe ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and counterfeit Religions, that ſpring from a <hi>natural belief of a Deity,</hi> from <hi>convictions, obſervations, fleſhly and low apprehenſions of Heaven, book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learning,</hi> and the <hi>precepts of men,</hi> as the Prophet calls them, and the reſt, which are ſeated in the fancie, and ſwim in the brain; whoſe effect is but to gild the outward man, or at beſt, but to move the ſoul by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal force, in an unn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The firſt proſelyte of it coucht un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this phraſe is, that is is <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>unconſtrained.</hi> Religion is a principle, and it flows and acts freely in the ſoul, after the manner of a fountain, and in the day of its mighty power makes the people a <hi>willing</hi> people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. and the ſoul in whom it is truly ſeated, to become a <hi>freewill offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> unto God. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great ſubdued the World with force of arms, and made men rather his tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries

               </gap>, the preſent yoke is alwayes grievous.

Now this willingneſs or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of godly ſouls might be explained
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103119:60"/> and confirmed by the conſideration both of their outward and inward acts.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Neither is it low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited and ſlaviſh as <hi>Fear</hi> is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it comes to full age, it will

Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it directly under the authority of any law, whether humane or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: it is not begotten by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a divine law, <hi>as a law,</hi> but as <hi>holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> as we ſhall ſee more anon:—<hi>quis legem dat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantibus? ipſe Eſt ſibi lex amor;</hi> the Law of Love, or if you will, in the Apoſtles phraſe, <hi>the ſpirit of love, and of power,</hi> in oppoſition to the ſpirit of fear (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7.) doth more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the godly man in his purſuit of God, than any law without him: this is as a <hi>wing</hi> to the Soul, whereas out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward commandments are but as <hi>guides</hi> in his way, or at moſt, but as <hi>ſpurs</hi> in his ſides.</p>
            <p>The ſame I may ſay of holy <hi>delight</hi> in God, which is indeed the <hi>flower</hi> of love, or love grown up to its full age and ſtature, which hath <hi>no torment</hi> in it, and conſequently no force upon it. Like unto which are holy <hi>confidence.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103119:64"/> Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> ingenuous and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts of the Religious Soul, whereby it haſtens into the Divine embraces, <hi>as the Eagle haſtneth to the prey,</hi> ſwiftly and ſpeedily, and not by force and conſtraint, <hi>as a fool to the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſtocks,</hi> or a bear to the ſtake. Theſe are all genuine off-ſprings of holy religion in the Soul, and they are utterly uncapable of force; Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is contrary to the nature of them; for to uſe the Apoſtles words, with the change of one word, <hi>Hope that is forc'd, is not hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a little further to explain this excellent property of true Religion, we may a little conſider, the <hi>Author</hi> and the <hi>object</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>author</hi> of this noble and Free principle is God himſelf who hath made it a partaker of his own nature, who is the <hi>Free agent,</hi> himſelf is the fountain of his own Acts. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created life and liberty, hath given this priviledge to the religious Soul, in ſome ſenſe to have life and liberty in it ſelf, and a dominion over its own Acts. I do not know that any created Being
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103119:64"/> in the world hath more of divinity in it than the Soul of man, <hi>qua nihil ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini dedit Deus ipſe divinius,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks; nor that any thing in the Soul doth more reſemble the Divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, than the noble <hi>Freedom</hi> that the ſoul hath in itſelf; which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is never ſo divine and generous, as when it is objected upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This excellent freedom is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God in the Soul of man, and therefore may juſtly claim the <hi>Free ſpirit</hi> for its author, <hi>Pſal. 51. 12. 2. Cor.</hi> 3. 17. or the Son of God for its original, according to that in Joh. 8. 36. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, then ſhall ye be free indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it may be demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the command of God do not act the godly ſoul, and ſet it upon its holy motions? I confeſs indeed that the command of God is much eyed by a godly man, and is of great weight with him, and do's in ſome ſenſe lay a conſtraint upon him: but yet I think not ſo much the <hi>authority</hi> of the Law, as the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of it, do's prevail principally
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103119:65"/> with him. The Religious Soul do's not ſo much eye the Law under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a command, as under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>holy, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, and ſo embraces it, chooſes it, and longs to be perfectly conformable to it. I do nor think it ſo proper to ſay that a good man loves God, and all righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and religious duties by vertue of a command to do ſo, as by vertue of a new nature that God hath put into him, which doth inſtruct and prompt him ſo to do. A religious Soul being reconciled to the nature of God, do's embrace all his Laws by vertue of the equitableneſs and perfection that he ſees in them; not becauſe they are <hi>commanded,</hi> but becauſe they are in themſelves <hi>to be deſired,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 10. In which Pſalm the holy man gives us a full account why he did ſo love and eſteem the laws and commandments of God, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are <hi>perfect, right, pure, clean, true, ſweet,</hi> and <hi>lovely,</hi> as you will find, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. To love the Lord our God with all our heart, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103119:65"/> ſtrength, and mind, is not only a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by vertue of that firſt and great commandment that doth require it; but indeed the higheſt priviledge, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and happineſs of the Soul. To this purpoſe may that profeſſion of the Pſalmiſts be applyed, Pſal. 119. 173. <hi>I have choſen thy precepts,</hi> and, ver. 30. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth.</hi> Chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is an act of judgement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and reſpects the <hi>quality of the thing,</hi> more than the <hi>authority of the command. David</hi> did not <hi>ſtumble</hi> into the way of truth accidentally by vertue of his education, or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or the like circumſtance, nor was he <hi>whipt</hi> or driven into it by the meer ſeverity of a law without him; but he <hi>choſe</hi> the way of truth, as that which was indeed moſt eligible, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and deſireable. What our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour ſayes concerning himſelf, is alſo true of every true Chriſtian in his meaſure, he makes it his <hi>meat and drink</hi> to do the will of God: Now we know that men do not eat and drink, becauſe Phyſitians preſcribe it as a means to preſerve life; but the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103119:66"/> ſenſual appetite is carryed out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards food, becauſe it is good, ſweet, ſuitable: ſo is the ſpiritual appetite carryed out towards ſpiritual food, not ſo much by the force of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal precept, as by the attractive power of that higher good which it finds ſuitable and ſufficient for it. As for the <hi>object</hi> of this Free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſpirit of Religion, it is no other than God himſelf principally and ultimately, and other things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are ſubſervient to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him. God as the ſupream good, able to fill and perfectly ſatisfie all the wants and indigencies of the ſoul, and ſo to make it wholly and eternally happy, is the proper object of the Souls moſt free and chearful motions. The Soul eyes God as the perfect and abſolute good, and God in Chriſt as a feaſable and attainable good, and ſo finds every way enough in this object to encourage it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after him, and throw it ſelf upon him. Religion fixes upon God, as upon its own centre, as upon its proper and adequate object; it views
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103119:66"/> God as the Infinite and abſolute good, and ſo is drawn to him without any external force. The Godly Soul is overpowred indeed, but it is only with the infinite goodneſs of God, which exerciſes its Soveraignty over all the faculties of the Soul; which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring is ſo far from ſtraitning or pinching it, that it makes it truly free and generous in its motions. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion wings the Soul, and makes it take a flight freely and ſwiftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and eternal life: it is of God, and by a ſympathy that it hath with him, it carryes the Soul out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and into conjunction with him. In a word, the godly Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſned from <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> emptyed of <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> beaten out of all <hi>ſelf-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> and delivered from all <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confining</hi> luſts, wills, intereſts and ends, and being mightily overcome with a ſenſe of a higher and more excellent good, goes after that freely, centres upon it firmly, graſps after it continually, and had rather be that than what itſelf is, as ſeeing that the nature of that ſupream good is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103119:67"/> infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itely more excellent and deſirable than its own.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly explain'd and confirmed the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the truly godly Soul: I would now make ſome little improvement of it, but that it ſeems needful I ſhould here interweave a cautionary conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It muſt be granted, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things without the Soul may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, in our common ſenſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to the Soul to quicken, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſten, and ſtrengthen it in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious acts. Though grace be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal principle, and moſt free from any conſtraint, yet it may be excited, or <hi>ſtirred up</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m.</hi> 1. 6. by ſuch means as God hath appointed hereunto, as prayer, meditation, reading, adminiſtration of our callings, as the Apoſtle intimates in the body of that forequoted Epiſtle. But perhaps there will a queſtion ariſe concerning ſome other things, which may ſeem to lay a conſtraint upon the ſpirits of men. I deny not but that the ſeemingly religious motions of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103119:67"/> many men are meerly violent, and their devotion is purely forc'd as we ſhall ſee by and by: but I affirm, and I think have confirmed it, that true and ſincere Religion is perfectly free and unconſtrain'd. This being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, now if you ask me what I think of <hi>afflictions,</hi> I confeſs God doth ordinarily uſe them as means to make good men better, and it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to make bad men good: theſe may be as <hi>weights</hi> to haſten and ſpeed the Souls motions towards God, but they do not principally beget ſuch motions. If you ask me of temporal <hi>proſperity,</hi> commonly called mercies and bleſſings, of promiſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards propounded; I confeſs they may be as <hi>oyle</hi> to the wheels, and ought to quicken and encourage to the ſtudy of true and powerful godlineſs; but they are not the ſpring of the ſouls motions: they ought to be unto us, as <hi>dew</hi> upon the graſs to refreſh and fructifie the Soul; but it is the <hi>root</hi> which properly gives life and growth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be granted that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103119:68"/> there is a kind of conſtraint and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity lying upon the godly Soul, in its holy and moſt excellent motions: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us;</hi> and again, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 16. Neceſſity is laid upon me</hi> to preach the Goſpel. But yet it holds good, that grace is a moſt free principle in the Soul, and that where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. For the conſtraint that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of is not oppoſed to <hi>freedom of Soul,</hi> but to <hi>not acting;</hi> Now although the Soul ſo principled and ſpirited cannot but act, yet it acts freely. Thoſe things that are according to nature though they be done neceſſarily, yet are they done with the greateſt freedom imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The water flows, and the fire burns neceſſarily, yet freely: Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a new nature in the ſoul, and the religious Soul being toucht effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h the ſenſe, and impreſt with the influences of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fulneſs and perfection, is carryed indeed neceſſarily towards God as its proper centre, and yet its motions are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103119:68"/> pure, free, generous and with the greateſt delight and pleaſure conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The neceſſity that lay upon <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Goſpel is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of any external violence that was done to him, much leſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>odily neceſſity, by reaſon of which many men ſerve <hi>their own bellyes</hi> in that great function, more than the Lord Jeſus; for though he preacht the Goſpel neceſſarily, yet did he preach freely and willingly, as he oft profeſſeth. The godly Soul cannot but love God as his chiefeſt good, yet he delights in this neceſſity, under which he lyeth, and is exceeding glad that he finds his heart framed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to love him. I ſay <hi>enlarged,</hi> becauſe God is ſuch an object, as do's not contract and pinch and ſtraiten the ſoul, as all created object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do, but ennoble, ampliate, and enlarge it. The ſinful ſoul, the more it lets out, and lays out, and ſpends itſelf upon the creature, the more it is ſtraitned and contracted, and the native free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of it is enſlaved, debaſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: but grace do's eſtabliſh and

               </gap>ed. I ſhall explain it brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in two or three particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Men force <hi>themſelves</hi> many times to ſome things in Religion, that are beſides, yea and againſt their nature and genius. I need not inſtance in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103119:69"/> an overly conformity to the letter of the law, and ſome external duties which they force themſelves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, as to hear, pray, give almes, or the like: in all which the violent and unnatural obedience of a <hi>phariſee</hi> may be more popular and ſpecious, than the true and genuine obedience of a free-born diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, If going on hunting, and catching of Veniſon might denominate a good and dutiful Son, <hi>Eſau</hi> may indeed be as acceptable to his father, as <hi>Jacob;</hi> but God is not ſuch a father as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> (whoſe affections were bribed with fat morſels,) he feeds not upon the pains of his children, nor drink, the ſweat of their brow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. I doubt not but that an unprincipled Chriſtian, that hath the heart of a ſlave; may alſo force himſelf to imitate the more ſpiritual part of Religion, and as it were to act over the very temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſon of God. Therefore we read of a ſemblance of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi> which was found in ſome, whom yet our Saviour reckons no better than <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> Mark. 4. 16. and of

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103119:70"/> is contrary to the nature of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal to magnifie and boaſt itſelf: And indeed it is very evident to a wiſe obſerver, that theſe men by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of voluntary humility, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſelf-denyal, do in truth endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour moſt of all to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and erect an idol of <hi>ſelf-ſupremacy</hi> in themſelves, and do really fall in love with an <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now there ſeem to be <hi>three</hi> things in a formal hypocrite, that do eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally force a kind of devotion and ſhew of religion from him, viz. <hi>Conſcience of guilt, ſelf-love,</hi> and <hi>Falſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God.

Thus we ſee how a man void of the life and ſpirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet forces himſelf to do God a kind of worſhip, and pay him a kind of homage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes men may be ſaid in a ſenſe to be forced by <hi>other men</hi> to put on a vizard of holineſs, a dreſs of Religion.

The godly ſoul puts it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the banner of Chriſt, fights under the conduct of the Angel of God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſo marches up undauntedly againſt the children of <hi>Anak,</hi> thoſe earthly loves, luſts, ſenſual affections, which are indeed taller and ſtronger than all other enemies that do encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it in this wilderneſs ſtate: and the gracious God is not wanting to ſuch endeavours, he <hi>remembring his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, helpeth his ſervants,</hi> even that promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 31.

But he makes war upon the remainder of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and is never at reſt till be have with <hi>Sarah,</hi> caſt out the bond woman and her Son too. You may ſee an
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103119:82"/> emblem of ſuch a ſoul in <hi>Moſes</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his hands all the day long, till <hi>Amalek</hi> was quite discomfited, <hi>Exo.</hi> 17. As oft as the floods of temptation, ſpringing from the Devil, the world, or the fleſh, do offer to come in upon him, he oppoſeth them in the ſtrength of Chriſt, or if you will, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets phraſe, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 19.) <hi>The Spirit of the Lord lifteth up a ſtandard againſt them,</hi> ſo that he is not <hi>carried down</hi> by them, or at leaſt, not <hi>overwhelmed</hi> with them. In the beginning of my diſcourſe upon this head, I hinted to you the reaſon why the godly ſoul continually ſtudies conformity of God, even becauſe he is the perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute good, and the ſoul reckons that its happineſs conſiſts only in being like unto him, in partaking of a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But I might alſo here take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſpeak of three things, which I will but briefly name, and ſo paſt on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A godly man reckons with himſelf, that conformity to the image and nature of God, is the moſt proper converſing with God in the world.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103119:82"/> The great, and indeed only imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an immortal ſoul, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with its Creator; for this end it was made, and made ſo capacious as we ſee it: Now to partake of a divine nature, to be indutd with a God-like diſpoſition, is moſt properly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God; this is a real, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, practical and feeling converſe with him, infinitely to be preferred before all notions, profeſſions, performances, or ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A godly man reckons that the image of God is the glory and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the ſoul; it is the luſtre, and, brightneſs, and beauty of the ſoul, as the ſoul is of the body. Holineſs is not only the duty, but the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity that any created nature is capable of: And therefore the godly ſoul, (who hath his ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern good and evil) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues after it, as after his ſull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A godly man reckons that conformity to the divine image, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the divine nature, is the ſureft and moſt comfortable evidence
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103119:83"/> of divine love, which is a matter of ſo great enquity in the world. By <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up</hi> daily in Chriſt Jeſus, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſured of our <hi>implantation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The Spirit of God deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſoul in the impreſſions of meekneſs, kindneſs, uprightneſs, which is a <hi>Dove-like diſpoſition,</hi> is a better, and more deſirable evidence of our Sonſhip, and God's favour towards us, than if we had the Spirit deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our heads in a <hi>Dove-like ſhape,</hi> as it did upon our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Theſe things may paſs for a kind of reaſons, why the religious Chriſtian, above all things, labours to become God-like, to be formed more and more into a reſemblance of the ſupreme good, and to drink in divine perfections into the very inmoſt of his ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The active and induſtrious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true Godlineſs, or Religion manifeſts its ſelf in a good man's <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual care, and ſtudy to do good, to ſerve the intereſt of the holy and bleſſed God in the world.</hi> A good man being maſtered with the ſenſe of the infinite
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103119:83"/> goodneſs of God, and the great: end of his life, cannot think it worth while to ſpend himſelf for any inferiour good, or beſtow his time and ſtrength for any lower end than that it; and therefore as it is the main <hi>happineſs</hi> of his life to <hi>enjoy</hi> God, ſo he makes it the main <hi>buſineſs</hi> of his life to <hi>ſerve</hi> him, to be doing for him, to lay out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for him, and to diſplay and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his glory in the world. And as he is raviſhed with the apprehenſions of the ſupreme goodneſs, which doth infinitely deſerve, and may juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all that he can do or expend for him, ſo he doth indeed really partake of the active and communicative na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that bleſſed Being, and himſelf becomes active and communicative too: A godly ſoul ſluggiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, is as if one ſhould ſay, a godly ſoul altogether unlike to God; a pure contradiction. I cannot dwell upon any of thoſe particular deſigus of ſerving the intereſt of God's glory, which a good man is ſtill driving on in the world: Only this in general, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pray, or preach, or read, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103119:84"/> celebrate Sabbaths, or adminiſter pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reproof or inſtruction, or indeed plow or ſow, eat or drink, all this while he lives not to himſelf, but ſerves an higher intereſt than that of the fleſh, and a higher good than himſelf, or any created Being. A true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian actively doth not only appear in thoſe things which call <hi>duties of Worſhip,</hi> or religious performances; but in the whole frame of the heart contriving, and the converſation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing and unfolding the glory of God. A holy, ſerious, heavenly, humble, ſober, righteous, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying courſe of life, do's moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently expreſs the divine glory, by imitating the nature of God, and moſt effectually call all men to the imitation of it; according as our Saviour hath nakedly ſtated the caſe, <hi>Joh. 15. 8. Hereby is my Father glorified, that ye bring forth much fruit:</hi> By which <hi>fruits</hi> are not to be underſtood only preaching, praying, conference, which are indeed high and excellent duties; but alſo righteouſneſs, temperance, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, which things are pure reflections
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103119:84"/> of the divine image, and a real glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God's Name and perfections. A good Chriſtian cannot be content to be happy alone, to be ſtill drawing down Heaven into his own ſoul; but he endeavours alſo both by prayer, counſel, and holy example, to draw up the ſouls of other men Heaven-ward. This God witneſſeth of <hi>Abraham, Gen. 18. 19. I know him, that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord:</hi> And this <hi>Moſes</hi> doth exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently witneſs of himſelf in that holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Would God that all the Lord's people were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them!</hi> By ſuch examples as theſe a good man deſires to live, yea by higher preſidents than either <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> or <hi>Moſes,</hi> even by the example of the <hi>Father and of the Son:</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires and ſtrives to imitate that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which is given of God himſelf. <hi>Pſal. 119. 68. Thou art good, and doſt good;</hi> and that which is given of Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord of life, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. Who <hi>went about doing good;</hi> who alſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103119:85"/> witneſſed elſewhere concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he came not into the world to do his own will, nor ſeek his own glory, but the will and glory of him that ſent him: And again, <hi>Luk. 2. 49. Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's buſineſs?</hi> Oh how happy would the godly ſoul count it ſelf, if it could but live and converſe in the world at the ſame rate, and with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, fervent, exalted ſpirit, as Chriſt Jeſus did, whoſe meat and drink it was ſtill to be doing the will, and advancing the glory of his Father! But (alas) the poor ſoul finds it ſelf enſnared by paſſions, and ſelfiſh affections from within, clogg'd with an unweildy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and diſtracted with ſecular affairs from without, that it cannot riſe ſo nimbly, run ſo ſwiftly, nor ſerve the infinite and glorious God ſo chearfully, nor liberally, as it would, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the poor priſoner ſigbs within it ſelf, and wiſhes that it might eſcape: But finding a certain time determined upon it in the body, which it muſt be content to live out, it looks up, and is ready to envy the Angels of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103119:85"/> it cannot live as they do, who are alwaies upon God's errand, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thinks much that it ſelf is not a <hi>Miniſtring Spirit,</hi> ſerving the pure and perfect will of the ſupreme good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging or ceaſing. The godly ſoul under theſe powerful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the nature of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, and the honourable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the holy Angels, is ready to grudge the body that attendance that it calls for, and thoſe offices which it is forc't to perform to it; as judging them impertinent to its main happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and moſt excellent employment; it is ready to envy that more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and willing ſervice, which it finds from the heavy and droſſy body with which it is united, and to cry out, Oh that I were that to my God, which my body, my eyes, hands and feet are to me! For I ſay to one of theſe, go, and he goeth: and to another, do this, and he doeth it. In a word, a good man being acquainted feelingly with the higheſt good, eying diligently the great end of his coming into the world, and his ſhort time of being in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103119:86"/> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>percinently; and he reckons all things that have not a tendency to the higheſt good, and a ſubſerviency to the great and laſt end, to be impertinencies, yea and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in an immortal ſoul, which ſhould continually be <hi>ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The active and vigorous nature of true Religion, manifeſts it ſelf in thoſe <hi>powerful and inceſſant longings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God,</hi> with which it fills that ſoul in which it is planted. This I ſuperadd to the two former, becauſe the godly man, though he be formed into ſome likeneſs to God, yet deſires to be more like him; and though he be ſomewhat ſerviceable to him, yet deſires to be more inſtrumental to his will: though he be good, yet deſires to be better;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103119:86"/> and though he do good, yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to do better, or at leaſt more. And indeed, I reckon that theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and holy hungrings after God, which I am going to ſpeak of, are one of the beſt ſigns that I know in the world, of ſpiritual health, and the beſt <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of a true Chriſtian: For in this low and animal ſtate, we are better acquainted with lovings and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than with fruition or ſatisfaction; and the beſt enjoyment that we have of God in this world, is but ſcant and ſhort, indeed but a kind of <hi>a longing to enjoy him.</hi> Love is certainly a high and noble affection; but (alas) our love, whilſt we are here in the body, is in its non-age, in its weak and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate, rather a <hi>longing,</hi> than a <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> much unlike to what it will be, when it ſhall be grown up unto its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtature in glory.

To be ſo far diſtant from God who is life and love itſelf, and the proper and full happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoul, is grievous to the ſoul that is rightly affected towards him; and hence it is that the ſoul cannot be at reſt, but ſtill longs to be more intimately joyned to him, and more perfectly filled with him: and the clearer the ſouls apprehenſions are of its object, and the deeper its ſenſe is of its own unlikeneſs to him, and diſtance from him, the more ſtrong and impatient are its breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; inſomuch that not only <hi>fear</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,) but even

            <p>WE have ſeen in what reſpects Religion is an <hi>Active</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the ſoul where it is ſeated: give me leave to enlarge a little here for <hi>Conviction</hi> or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103119:95"/> By this property of true Religion we ſhall be able to diſcover much that is falſe and counterſeit in the world. If Religion be no lazy, languid, ſluggiſh, paſſive thing, but <hi>lift, love,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit of power</hi> and <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> a <hi>fire burning, a well of water ſpringing up,</hi> as we have ſufficiently ſeen, what ſhall we ſay then of that heavy, ſluggiſh, ſpiritleſs kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that moſt men take up with? Shall we call it a <hi>ſpirit of life,</hi> with the Apoſtle; and yet allow of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that is cold and <hi>dead?</hi> ſhall we call it a ſpirit of love and power, with the ſame Apoſtle; and yet allow of it, though it be indifferent low, and impotent? or will ſuch paſs for currant with the wiſe and holy God, it we ſhould paſs a favourable cenſure upon it? And why ſhould it ever paſs with men, if it will not for ever paſs with God? But indeed how can this inactivity and ſluggiſhneſs paſs for Religion amongſt men? who can think you are in purſuit of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and ſupream good, that ſees you ſo ſlow in your motions towards it?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103119:96"/> who can think that your treaſure is in Heaven, that ſees your heart ſo far from thence? The more any thing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of God, and the nearer it comes to him who is the fountain of life and power and vertue, the more active, powerful and lively will it be. We read of an Atheiſtical generation in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 12. who fancied to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an idle and ſlothful God, that minded not the affairs of the world at all, ſaying, <hi>the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil;</hi> which was alſo the falſe and groſs conceit of many of the Heathen, as <hi>Cicero</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes of ſome of the Philoſophers themſelves, <hi>qui Deum nihil habere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotii dicunt &amp; nihil exhibere alteri:</hi> And indeed though it be not ſo <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,</hi> yet it is almoſt as <hi>abſurd,</hi> to fancy an idle <hi>Saint,</hi> as an idle <hi>Deity.</hi> Sure I am, if it be not altogether impoſſible, yet it is altogether a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull and deformed ſight, a holy ſoul in a lethargy, a godly ſoul that is not in purſuit of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed bids <hi>Iſrael ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord;</hi> but there is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103119:96"/> no ſuch divinity in the holy Scriptures as this, ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the ſoul (though ſome have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently preſt thoſe words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 13. to ſerve under their ſlothful ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard:) No, no, the Scripture ſpeaks to us at another rate, Phil. 2. 12. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But that I may more powerfully convince and awaken the lazy and heavy ſpirit and temper of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, I will briefly touch upon a few particulars, which I will next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to their ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The children of this world, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſenſual men, are not ſo ſlothful, ſo lazy, ſo indifferent in the purſuit of earthly and ſenſual objects.</hi> You ſay you have laid up your <hi>treaſure in Heaven;</hi> we know they have laid up

            <p>But you will ask me when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may be ſaid to be ſluggiſh and unactive, and who theſe lazy ſouls are. I will <hi>premiſe</hi> two things, and then give you a brief account of them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> When I ſpeak of a ſluggiſh and ſpiritleſs Religion, I do not ſpeak as the hot-ſpirited <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> or <hi>Chili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who being themſelves acted by a ſtrange <hi>fervour of mind,</hi> miſcalled <hi>zeal,</hi> are wont to declaim againſt all men as cold and benummed in their ſpirits, who do not call for <hi>fire from Heaven</hi> to conſume all diſſenters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> who are not afraid to reproach the divine, holy, gentle, yet generous ſpirit of Religion, calling it weak, womaniſh, cowardly, low, cold, and I know not what. Theſe men I believe (ſo far as I can gueſs at their ſpirit) if they had lived in the dayes of our Saviour, and had beheld that gentle, meek, humble, peaceable and pacate ſpirit, which did infinitely ſhine forth in him, would have gone nigh to have repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him for not carrying on his own Kingdom with ſufficient vigour and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103119:100"/> activity; if not have judged <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf to be much <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> I hope you ſee nothing in all my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Active ſpirit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that ſavours of ſuch a fiery ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as this is. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when I do ſo highly commend the Active ſpirit of true Religion, and the vigorous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of truly Religious ſouls, I would not be underſtood, as if I thought all ſuch ſouls were alike ſwift, or that any ſuch ſoul did alwayes move with like ſwiftneſs, and keep a like pace towards God. I know that there are different <hi>ſizes of Active ſouls,</hi> yea and <hi>different degrees of Activity in the ſame ſoul:</hi> as may be ſeen, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3. compared with the ſixth verſe of the ſame chapter; and in many other places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But yet that none may flatter and deceive themſelves with an opinion of their being what indeed they are not, I will briefly diſcover the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs and inactivity of Chriſtians in a few particulars. I pray take it not ill though the greateſt part of Chriſtians be found guilty; for that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103119:100"/> is no other than what Chriſt himſelf hath propheſied.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Active ſpirit of Religion in the ſoul will not ſuffer men to take up their reſt in a conſtant courſe of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal performances;</hi> and they are but ſlothful ſouls that do place their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in any thing without them. By external performances, I mean not only open and publick and ſolemn ſervices, but even the moſt private, and ſecret performances that are in and by the body, and <hi>ab extra</hi> to the ſoul. It is not poſſible that a ſoul ſhould be happy in any thing that is <hi>extrinſecal</hi> to itſelf; no not in God himſelf, if we conſider him only as ſomething without the ſoul: The devil himſelf knows and ſees much of God without him, but having no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of a divine nature or life, being perfectly eſtranged from the life of God, he remains perfectly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. I doubt it is a common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in the world, men toyle and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in bodily acts of worſhip and Religion in a ſlaviſh and mercinary manner, and think (with thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103119:101"/> in the parable) that at the end they muſt needs receive great wages, and much thanks, becauſe they have born <hi>the heat and burden of the day.</hi> Alas that ever men ſhould ſo groſly miſtake the nature of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to ſink it into a few bodily acts and carcaſe-ſervices, and to think it is nothing elſe but a running the round of duties and ordinances, and a keeping up a conſtant ſet and courſe of actions! ſuch an external legal righteouſneſs the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> after his converſion, could not take up with, but counted it all <hi>loſs and dung</hi> in compariſon of that Godlike righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which was now brought into his ſoul, that inward and ſpiritual conformity to Chriſt, which was now wrought in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10. I know indeed that men will be loth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they place their Religion in any thing without them; but I pray conſider ſeriouſly wherein you excell other men, ſave only in praying or hearing now and then, or ſome other outward acts, and judge your ſelves by your <hi>nature,</hi> and not by your <hi>actions.</hi>

Again, obſerve how all things in the world purſue their ſeveral perfections with unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and impatient longings, and ſay, come my ſoul, and do thou likewiſe.

            </argument>
            <p>I Come now to the third property of true Religion contained in theſe words, and that is the <hi>perſeverance</hi> of it. And here the foundation of my following diſcourſe ſhall be this propoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True Religion is a laſting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering principle in the Souls of good men.</hi> It is ſaid of the hypocritical Jews, that their goodneſs was as the <hi>early dew that ſoon paſſeth away,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 4. But that principle of true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God planteth in the ſouls of his people is compared to a <hi>well of water,</hi> evermore ſending forth freſh ſtreams, and inceſſantly ſpringing up towards God himſelf: our Saviour compares hypocritical profeſſors to <hi>ſeed ſown upon ſtony ground</hi> that ſprings up indeed, but ſoon withers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103119:108"/> away, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 5, 6. but this well of water which is in the ſincere godly ſoul, ſprings up <hi>into everlaſting life,</hi> it ſprings and is never dryed up, <hi>it is a ſpring of water, whoſe waters fail not,</hi> or lyes not, as it is expreſt by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 11. Or if you look upon it under the Metaphor of <hi>oyle,</hi> as it is ſometimes expreſt in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, then it is truly that Oyle that faileth not, whereof the Widow of <hi>Sarepthahs</hi> cruiſe of Oyle was but a ſcant reſemblance. Amongſt other Texts which the learned Dr. <hi>Arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith</hi> brings to prove the infallibility of the perſeverance of Saints, this ſpeech of our Saviours which is the ſubject of my whole diſcourſe, is one; who alſo quoteth <hi>Theophylact</hi> for the ſame mind, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>perſeverance</hi> of this principle, yea and ſome what more, even the <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>multiplication</hi> of it. To the ſame purpoſe the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Author quoteth, <hi>Joh. 10. 27, 28.

            <p n="2">2. It doth not ariſe from <hi>the ſtrength of mans Free will,</hi> as if he were of himſelf able to keep himſelf for ever in a ſtate of grace, when God had once put him into it.

            <p>I proceed now to ſpeak ſomething <hi>affirmitively</hi> concerning the grounds of the Saints perſeverance in a ſtate of grace.

Thoſe ſeveral acts of divine grace mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. though they be many <hi>links,</hi> yet run one into an other, and all from firſt to laſt make up but one <hi>chain;</hi> concerning which divine and myſterious concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation one may boldly uſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory prohibition which our Lord uſeth concerning a leſs indiſputable conjunction, Matth. 19. 6. <hi>What God

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The grace of Juſtification is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpended nor violated, it admits neither of interciſion nor reſciſſion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of pauſe nor period.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> in the Apoſtles ſentence, but the copulative <hi>[and] Rom.</hi> 8. 30. there is nothing between a juſtified ſoul and glory, but a meer <hi>paſſage</hi> into it. May we be allowed to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with the holy Apoſtle in the forequoted chapter, who ſhall bring an accuſation againſt Gods elect? <hi>It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> But what though you be at preſent juſtified may ſome ſay, is there not a poſſibility of being unjuſtified again, may not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the righteous be taken from him, may you not be condemned hereafter? But <hi>who is he that ſhall condemn us? It is Chriſt that dyed:</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, the love of God towards his juſtified ones is not grounded upon their purity, lovelineſs or perfection, but it is founded in their Redeemer, which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103119:114"/> Redeemer hath done enough, both to bring them into a juſtified ſtate, and to keep them in it for ever; It is <hi>Chriſt that dyed,</hi> to free them from ſin, it is Chriſt that is <hi>riſen again</hi> for their juſtification; that <hi>is at the right hand of God,</hi> to deliver them from all their enemies, that <hi>maketh interceſſion</hi> for them, for their perſeverance. God loves nothing but the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of himſelf, ſo far as any thing partakes of the divine image, ſo far it partakes of divine favour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, ſo that whileſt a good man bears a reſemblance unto God, ſo long he ſhall be accepted of him, and embraced in the arms of his love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſhall be for ever, as we ſhall ſee under the next head. Untill you have blotted out all the image and ſuperſcription of God out of a godly ſoul, untill you have razed out all the ſtamps and impreſſions of goodneſs: in a word, untill you have rendred him wicked and ungodly, you cannot abandon him from the embraces of God; which thing men and devils ſhall never be able to do, as I have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103119:115"/> partly ſhewed already, and ſhall yet ſhew more at large.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed that <hi>Adam</hi> fell from a juſt ſtate though not from a juſtified ſtate, for that ſuppoſes ſin formerly committed. But this is no great wonder; for he had his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in himſelf, and his happineſs in his own keeping: But the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believers is now more ſafe and firm, as depending not upon any created power or will, but upon the infinite and effectual help and ſtrength of a Mediator, which will never fail.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The covenant of grace is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> It hath pleaſed God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a covenant of grace and peace with every believing ſoul; which I ſuppoſe I need not go about to prove, all Chriſtians acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, though they do not all agree in one notion of it.

               </gap>, <hi>the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:103119:115"/> Heb. 13. 20. and again Jer. 32. 40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them:</hi> which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the everlaſtingneſs of it are fully explained in the following words, <hi>I will not turn away from them to do them good:</hi> The inviolable nature of this Covenant is alſo expreſly aſſerted in that famous place, Jer. 31 31, 32. <hi>I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, not according to the Covenant that I made with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which my Covenant they brake:</hi> as if he had ſaid, I will make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that ſhall not be ſubject to breaches: In the former Covenant with their fathers, I gave them laws to keep which they kept not, but in the New Covenant I will give them alſo a heart to keep my laws: It is not poſſible that Covenant ſhould be broken, one principle part of which is an heart both able and willing to keep it. The ſimilitudes which God uſeth in the 35, 36, 37. verſes of that ſame chapter, do alſo further confirm and illuſtrate this Doctrine of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs of this Covenant of grace.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:103119:116"/>
            <p>Under this head, let me glance at three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Mediator of this Covenant lives for ever, and lives to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for believers,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. and from this the Apoſtle argues, that they ſhall be ſaved to the uttermoſt, or evermore, as the Margin reads it. From this alſo the Apoſtle argues the unchangeable ſtate of believers, as we obſerved before out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. Chriſt Jeſus is alwayes heard and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Father in all the requeſts that he maketh to him, according to that in Joh. 11. 41, 42. <hi>Jeſus lift up his eyes and ſaid, Father I thank thee that thou haſt heard me; And I know that thou heareſt me alwayes.</hi> If theſe things be ſo, then the perſeverance of the Saints is built upon a moſt certain bottome, is ſecured againſt the very gates of Hell, for Chriſt hath prayed for them that they may be where he is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. and in the mean time that they may be kept <hi>from the evil,</hi> ver. 15. and that their faith <hi>fail not,</hi> Luke 22. 32.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:103119:116"/>2. <hi>The promiſes of this Covenant are immutable, they are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus yea and Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. as if one ſhould ſay in Latine, <hi>Certo certiora,</hi> perfectly ſure and certain. God who is truth itſelf, will not, can not be unto his people as a lyar, or <hi>as waters that fail,</hi> as the Prophets phraſe is; the infinite fountain of grace and truth, cannot poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like one of the brooks which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, which ſeem to be full of water, and are ſo at a certain win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon, but when the poor ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Arabian</hi> comes to look for water thence in ſummer, he goes away aſhamed, becauſe they are now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they are conſumed out of their place, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 19, 20. Now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is concerning not only grace, but the final perſeverance of it: If he promiſe pardoning grace, it is in theſe full and ſatisfying expreſſions, <hi>I will remember their ſin</hi> (any one of their ſins) <hi>no more,</hi> Jer. 31. 34. If he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe purging and purifying grace, it is in the like amplitude of phraſe, <hi>that they may fear me for ever;</hi> and again,

<q>God doth not give unto his Saints (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) only ſuch help, without which they could not perſevere if they would (which was that which he gave <hi>Adam;</hi>) but he alſo worketh in them the will: that becauſe they ſhall not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere except they both can and will, his bountifull grace beſtoweth upon them both the <hi>can</hi> and the <hi>will.</hi> For their will is ſo enflamed by the ſpirit of God, that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can, becauſe they ſo will, they therefore ſo will, becauſe God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them to Will.</q> Neither is it any diſparagement or injury to the freedom of mans will, that it ſhould

               </gap>ctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will of man is indeed the imperfection of it, and the more God reveals himſelf to the ſoul as the chiefeſt good, the more this indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the will is deſtroyed, and the faculty is determined; not by being <hi>conſtrained,</hi> but indeed <hi>perfected.</hi> Oh unhappy liberty, for a ſoul to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently affected towards its own happineſs, and to be free to chooſe its own miſery! The nobleſt freedom in the world is, when a ſoul being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from its heſitancies, and healed of its indifferencies, is carryed like a ſhip with ſpread ſales and powerfull winds in a moſt ſpeedy, cheerful and ſteady courſe into its own harbour, into the arms and embraces of its own object. The grace of God doth never ſo overpower the will of man as to reduce it to a condition of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſo as that man ſhould not have a proper dominion over his own acts; but I think we do generally conclude that in the world to come, in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103119:120"/> ſtate, the wills of all glorified Saints ſhall be ſo advanced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in their freedome, as not in the leaſt to verge towards any thing that is evil, but ſhall in the moſt gladſome and ſteady manner be eternally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed towards their full and glorious object, which the glorified under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall then repreſent in a moſt true clear and ample manner: And this we take to be the ſouls trueſt liberty in the higheſt elevation of it. Now although it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together thus with us in this preſent world, (for by reaſon of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and muddineſs of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings which do here repreſent God unto us ſo faintly and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly, it comes to paſs that the will cannot ſo freely and fervently, with ſo ardent and generous moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons purſue its excellent object, as it ſhall do hereafter) yet I believe that the more God reveals himſelf to any ſoul, the more the fluctuations and aequilibriouſneſs of it are healed, and a true liberty of will encreaſed; and that he doth ſo far reveal himſelf
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103119:121"/> to every truly godly ſoul, as to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh this noble freedome in him, in ſuch a degree as will keep him from willing a final departure from him, and carry him certainly, (how remiſly and faintly ſoever) towards the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and ſoveraign good, till he come to be perfectly ſwallowed up in it. A <hi>will</hi> thus truly and divinely free, thought it be not the proper <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe,</hi> yet certainly is an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>concomitant</hi> of final perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. So then the more God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth himſelf to any ſoul, the more powerfully it willeth a nearer conjunction with him; and no ſoul I conceive to whom God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth himſelf ſavingly can at any time will an utter ſeparation from him.</p>
            <p>As for the fouleſt falls of Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaints, that are any where recorded, I know not what more can rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inferred from them but that grace in the creature admits of ebbs and flows, is ſubject to augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diminutions; which I know no ſober perſon that denies. But I think
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103119:121"/> the hiſtory of their lapſes, if we take it altogether, hath a very favourable aſpect upon the doctrine of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; yea for ought I know, one great deſign of God in penning thoſe relations might be to confirm this very doctrine, by giving us ſo expreſs and ample an account of their <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Recovery,</hi> that we are indeed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were ſtrengthned by their falls, ſo far were their falls from prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortal to them: one would think that if ever the habits of grace ſhould be utterly ſuffocated and extinct, if ever they ſhould languiſh even unto death, it ſhould be under the power of ſuch contrary Acts as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> committed, and eſpecially <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> whoſe acts for ought I can ſee were as foul, and alſo <hi>often repeated,</hi> which is the likelieſt thing that I know, to deſtroy gracious habits. I know there are inſtances given of good <hi>Joaſh, Hymeneus, Alexander, Demas</hi> utterly falling from that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate, wherein ſometimes they had been. But it did never yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me beyond contradiction,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103119:122"/> that ever they were any of them in ſuch a ſtate. <hi>Joaſh</hi> is put amongſt the number of hypocrites by ſome that have rifled his ſtory: And for ought that can evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the contrary, <hi>Demas</hi> might be no better. Moſt is pleaded for <hi>Hymentus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> who put away a good conſcience, and made ſhipwrack of faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 19. 20. But it do's not yet appear that the <hi>faith</hi> which they made ſhipwrack of, was any more than the profeſſion or doctrine of the true faith; yea rather it doth appear that it was no more. Neither do's it at all appear that they ever had that <hi>good conſcience</hi> which they are ſaid (in our tranſlation) to have put away; which may as fully be rendred [<hi>rejected;</hi>] for that we find to be the moſt common uſe of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:103119:122"/> poſſibly ſome <hi>plank</hi> or other of it might be left. And who dare ſay that it was final? The Apoſtle doth not that I perceive give them up for loſt, but executes diſcipline upon them as it ſeems for their receovery, of which one might think by the following words, that he had ſome hopes—<hi>that they may learn not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</hi> In ſhort then, as to theſe two men, I conceive, that <hi>good can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> which they <hi>put away</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had, and the <hi>faith</hi> which they <hi>had</hi> was not <hi>that good faith.</hi> And as to the other two that were named, and indeed as to all other inſtances of the like nature, I ſuppoſe we may give this general anſwer, that <hi>either they did but ſeem to ſtand, er they did but ſeem to fall:</hi> the former perhaps was the caſe of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and the latter of <hi>Demas.</hi> When ever you obſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the backſlidings of any ſeeming Chriſtians take heed of concluding raſhly againſt the perſeverance of Saints, but rather inferr with the holy Apoſtle, 1 Joh. 2. 19. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us: had
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103119:123"/> they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us;</hi> Which words if they be meant only of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in doctrine and profeſſion, ſo as to conclude againſt the ſeparation of ſuch as are indeed in ſuch a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; then we may argue the more ſtrongly, <hi>a minore ad majus</hi> againſt the final apoſtaſie of any that are in a higher and more excellent commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to ſuppoſe a mans falling away from grace and turning from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; I conceive a fair anſwer may be given unto them by diſtinguiſhing of righteouſneſs; and ſo it may be granted that many men have turned away from, and utterly made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of their legal righteouſneſs, conſiſting in an external conformity to the letter of the precepts of the law, void of the ſupernatural and divine principle: it is indeed the common lot of theſe men that ſpring up thus fairly, and yet have no root, to <hi>wither away,</hi> Mat. 13. 6. Luk. 8. 6. And yet on the other hand it abides
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103119:123"/> an everlaſting maxime of truth, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. If there be any texts that ſeem to ſpeak of apoſtatizing from an Evangelical righteouſneſs, a righteouſneſs of faith, and ſo cannot well be ſalved by this diſtinction, as that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. and ſome others; it muſt be conſidered that ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made of things impoſſible as well as poſſible, yea and that even in the Scriptures themſelves, as ſome have obſerved from <hi>Gal. 1. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 14. which texts do not at all <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> what they <hi>ſuppoſe.</hi> I know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that external ſalvation is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily entailed upon perſeverance, and ſo is promiſed to us in Scripture, as it were <hi>conditionally,</hi> Joh 8. 31. <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed,</hi> Col. 1. 21, 22, 23. <hi>you hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death to preſent you holy and unblameable and unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his ſight, If ye continue in the faith, and be not moved away from
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103119:124"/> the hope of the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. To the ſame purpoſe are thoſe words, <hi>He that endureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and Rev. 2. 26. <hi>He that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give,</hi> &amp;c. All which do ſtrongly imply that there is no ſalvation but in a way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; and the words being laid down thus conditionally (eſpecially the words firſt quoted) are indeed cautionary and quickning to the dull and ſluggiſh minds of men, but do not neceſſarily imply any uncertainty or doubtfulneſs in the thing itſelf; no more than thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 10. compared with the latter end of the 12. <hi>verſe</hi> where he doth affirm them to be <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht in the truth,</hi> and yet at the ſame time doth ſpeak to them by way of caution and encouragement. There are many Texts that do ſeem to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the apoſtaſie of men in a ſtate of regeneration, but not one that doth aſſert it, that ever I could yet find; but they are almoſt without number that to my apprehenſion do more
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103119:124"/> than ſeem to aſſert the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>final perſeverance:</hi> of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance we have alſo through the goodneſs of God thouſands of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but no man could ever yet produce one inſtance of the contrary, but by meer conjecture; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, let them that make them ſee that they be neither <hi>over-charitable</hi> towards men, or <hi>uncharitable</hi> towards God. Wherefore I do conclude that what is ſaid concerning <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> in the Parable, (as to one branch of it) is true of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; a gulf is fized,</hi> and they that would paſs from God to ſin and the devil cannot: not that there ſhall ever be in any a real and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant deſire ſo to paſs, as I ſuppoſe I have already proved; but it denotes the impoſsibility of the thing. It is equally impoſſible that a godly ſoul ſhould fall from God and become an hater of him, fall from his love and image, and take upon him the image of the devil, as it was for <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103119:125"/> the former being the moſt reall Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the latter the trueſt Hell. True Religion is that holy fire which being once kindled in the ſoul from Heaven, never goes out; whereof the fire of the altar was but a faint and imperfect reſemblance: It is as true in this reſpect of good men, as it is of wicked men in an other, <hi>their fire never goes out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here now we are preſented with another great difference between true and counterfeit Religion. All counterfeit Religion will fade in time, though never ſo ſpecious and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; All dew will paſs away though ſome lye much longer than other; All land-floods will fail, yea the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> at length dryed up, though it were of many moneths du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But this <hi>well of water</hi> which our Saviour ſpeaks of here, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver utterly fail; <hi>cold Adverſity</hi> cannot <hi>freeze</hi> it up, <hi>ſcorching proſperity</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>dry</hi> it up: The upper ſprings of uncreated grace and goodneſs will evermore feed thoſe nether ſprings of grace and holineſs in the creature.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103119:125"/> Though Heaven and earth paſs away, yet ſhall the ſeed of God remain; <hi>he that hath begun a good work, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perform it,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. Where the grace of God hath begotten a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principle and ſpirit of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in a ſoul, there is the central force even of Heaven itſelf, ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and carrying the ſoul in its motions thitherward, untill it have lodged it in the very boſome and heart of God.

A meteor that is exhaled from the earth by a forreign force, though it may mount high in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and brave it in a blaze enough to be envyed by the poor twinkling ſtars, and to be admired by ordinary ſpectators, yet its fate is to fall down, and ſhamefully confeſs its baſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.

To this purpoſe I might fairly alleadge the frequent teſtimonies which the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture gives concerning ſuch hypocritical and unprincipled profeſſors that having <hi>no root</hi> they wither away in a ſcorching ſeaſon,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103119:126"/> that they are again <hi>entangled in the pollutions of the world</hi> and overcome, that like dogs they turn to their own <hi>vomit</hi> again, and like Sows wallow in the <hi>mire</hi> from which they had been waſhed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 22. together with many others of the ſame nature: as alſo the propheſies that are made concerning them, that that which they ſeemed to have, ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. that they ſhall <hi>proceed no further, for their folly ſhall be manifeſt to all men,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 9. that <hi>evil men and ſeducers</hi> (and of thoſe, ſelf-ſeducers are the worſt) <hi>ſhall wax worſe and worſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 13. with other places of the like nature. It were eaſie to record many hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of many men, eſpecially great men, who have ſpeedily; I had almoſt ſaid diſdainfully thrown off that ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of humility, meekneſs, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, juſtice and faithfulneſs which they had put on for a vizard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their probationarſhip for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, the better to accompliſh their ſelfiſh deſigns, and to be poſſeſt of ſome baſe ends of their own.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103119:127"/> But yet I will not deny, but that a hypocrite may maintain a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to, and correſpondence with the letter of the law of God, he may continue fair and ſpecious to the very end of his life, yea perhaps may go to his grave undiſcovered either to himſelf or any in the world beſides. I believe many men have <hi>lived</hi> and <hi>dyed</hi> Phariſees, have never apoſtatized from that righteouſneſs which they profeſt, but have perſevered in their formality and hypocriſie to the laſt. But yet although that counterfeit righteouſneſs and Religion may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly not fade away, yet nevertheleſs being of an earthly and ſelfiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it is tranſitory and fading, and if it were ſoundly aſſaulted and battered with perſecutions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, no doubt would actually vaniſh and diſappear; on the other hand, the promiſe of God is pregnant and precious, Iſa. 40. 31. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall walk and no faint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take encouragement from hence all ye that love the Lord, go on in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103119:127"/> the ſtrength of God; Be the more lively, by how much the more you are aſſured that this well of water ſhall ſpring up in you into everlaſting life. Make this good uſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine: will God indeed work in you, <hi>both to will and to do?</hi> why then ſo much the rather <hi>work out your own ſalvation,</hi> according to the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. will the Lord God <hi>be with you,</hi> will he <hi>not fail you nor forſake you, till you have finiſhed all your work?</hi> why then <hi>Be ſtrong, and of good courage, and do,</hi> as good <hi>David</hi> inferrs and argues, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 20. Have you this hope, this firm ground of hope in the promiſe and goodneſs of God? why then <hi>purifie your ſelves as God is pure;</hi> according to the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. ſtop the mouths of thoſe men that ſay <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of perſeverance is prejudicial to godlineſs;</hi> let them ſee, and be forced to acknowledge it, that the more a godly ſoul is aſſured of the infinite and unchangeable love and care of God towards him, the more is he winged with love and zeal, with ſpeed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103119:128"/> mounting up thither daily where he longs to arrive. They that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the doctrine of perſeverance, do alſo underſtand that they muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it in a way of dutifull diligence, and watchfull willingneſs; and if any grow prophane and licentious, and apoſtatize from the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they have known, it is an evident argument to them that they are no Saints, and then what will the doctrine of the perſeverance of Saints avail them?</p>

            <argument>
               <p> Religion conſidered in the conſequent of Not thirſting: the phraſe explained two wayes, both reſulting into the ſame general truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that divine grace gives a ſolid ſatisfaction to the ſoul. This Aphoriſme confirmed by ſome Scriptures, and largely explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſix propoſitions. The firſt, that there is a raging thirſt in every ſoul of man, after ſome ultimate and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory good: The ſecond, that every natural man thirſteth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally after happineſs in the creature: The third that no man can find that ſoul-filling ſatisfaction in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyment which every natural man principally ſeeketh therein; this proſecuted in two particulars: The fourth, that grace takes not away the ſouls thirſt after happineſs, but much enflames it; the reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. The fifth, that the godly ſoul thirſteth no more after Reſt in any worldly thing, but in God alone;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103119:129"/> this proſecuted in both the branches of it; in the former more largely, where enquiry is made how far a godly man may be ſaid to thirſt after the creature, and anſwered in four particulars: the latter briefly toucht upon. The ſixth, that in the enjoyment of God the ſoul is at Reſt; and this in a double ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as that it is perfectly matcht with its object; two things noted for the clearing of this; Secondly, ſo ſatisfied as to have joy and pleaſure in him; a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of that joy. The chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expires in a paſſionate lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken up over the levity and earthlineſs of Chriſtian minds.</p>

            <p>HItherto we have taken a view of true Religion as it ſtands deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this pregnant text by its <hi>original, nature,</hi> and <hi>properties:</hi> we are now to conſider it in the certain
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103119:129"/> and genuine <hi>conſequent</hi> of it; and that is in one word Affirmatively, <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> or if you will, negatively, <hi>not thirſting:</hi> for ſo it is in our Saviours phraſe, <hi>whoſoever drinketh of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt I addreſs my ſelf to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this phraſe, I ſuppoſe I need not be ſo exact and curious as to tell you in order, with a certain kind of Scholaſtical gravity, firſt, what is nor, and then what is meant by it: For I preſume no body will dream of a <hi>corporeal</hi> or groſs kind of thirſting to be meant here. Grace doth no more quench the thirſt of the body, than elementary water can relieve the panting of the ſoul. Nay he himſelf was ſubject to this groſs kind of thirſt, who gave to others the water whereof if they drank, they ſhould never thirſt more. If it be underſtood of a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> thirſt, yet I ſuppoſe I need not to tell you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that then it muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>abſolutely:</hi> For it cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be that the thirſt of a Soul ſhould
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103119:130"/> be perfectly allayed, till all its faculties be filled up to the brim of their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive capacities; which will never be untill it be ſwallowed up in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and unbounded Ocean of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream good.</p>
            <p>But I conceive we may fairly come to the meaning of this phraſe [<hi>never thirſt</hi>] either by <hi>adding</hi> or <hi>diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then let us ſupply the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thus, <hi>whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt after any other water.</hi> There is no worldly liquor can be ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated or attempered to the Palate as to give it an univerſal ſatisfaction, ſo as that a man ſhould be perfectly mortified to all variety: But this Heavenly water which our Saviour treats of here, is ſo fitted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of ſpirits, and brings ſuch ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction along with it, that the ſoul that is made to drink of it do's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percede its chaſe of all other delights, counts all other waters but a filthy and ſtinking <hi>puddle,</hi> thirſts no more after any other thing, neither through
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103119:130"/> 
               <hi>neceſſity</hi> nor for <hi>variety.</hi> The more the ſoul drinks of this water indeed, the more it thirſteth after fuller mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and larger potions of the ſame, and do's not only ſuck in divine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and influences, but even longs to be itſelf ſuckt up in the divinity, as we ſhall ſee further in the procedure of this diſcourſe: But its thirſt after all created good, all the waters of the Ciſtern are hereby extinguiſhed, or at leaſt maſtered and mortified. Or,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> upon thirſt, the ſenſe of the phraſe will be clearly this, whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him ſhall never <hi>be at a loſs more,</hi> never <hi>be to ſeek any more,</hi> never be uncertain or unſatisfied as to his main happineſs or ſupream object, be ſhall not rove and range up and down the world in an unfixedneſs and ſuſpenſe any more, ſhall not run up and down to ſeek ſatisfaction and reſt any more. From an internal unſatisfiedneſs of the body ſpring violent and reſtleſs motions and runnings up and down, by which thirſt is contracted; ſo that by a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103119:131"/> 
               <hi>Metonymy</hi> thirſt comes to be uſed for <hi>unſatisfiedneſs,</hi> which is the remote cauſe of it; and by a <hi>metaphor</hi> the ſame phraſe comes to be applyed to the ſoul. I ſuppoſe I am warranted by the ſacred ſtyle thus to interpret, eſpecially by the uſe and explication of the phraſe in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. where the Prophet intimates that by thirſt is to be meant a reſtleſs and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed running up and down to ſeek ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, <hi>withhold thy foot from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſhod, and thy throat from thirſt,</hi> which two phraſes are of the ſame importance, and ſignifie no more than <hi>ceaſe from gadding after your Idols;</hi> and that this is the meaning of that thirſting appears by the anſwer that the wilfull and deſperate people make in the ſequel of the verſe: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying, no, but we will thirſt, they cry, <hi>no, but after them will I goe.</hi> To thirſt then, is in an unſatisfiedneſs and ſpiritual diſquiet to range up and down ſeeking ſomething wherein ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately to acquieſce. And in this ſenſe it is moſt true what our Lord here pronounceth, that <hi>whoſoever drinketh
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103119:131"/> of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Of which thirſt that famous Proclamation of our Saviours is to be underſtood, Joh. 7. 37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink;</hi> in which place alſo we muſt neceſſrily underſtand what is here expreſt, that then he ſhall never thirſt more.</p>
            <p>It matters not much by which of theſe two wayes we explain the phraſe here of [<hi>not thirſting;</hi>] for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to either of them it will reſult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this theological <hi>maxime,</hi> viz. that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Divine grace or true Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion gives a real and ſolid ſatisfaction to the ſoul that is principled with it.</hi> This will appear plain, though we apply but out of each Teſtament of the holy Scriptures one text there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. I think it cannot reaſonably be doubted but that the Propheſie and promiſe made in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 10. is to be performed unto believers in this preſent life, for ſo muſt the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes neceſſarily be underſtood; and there we have the doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103119:132"/> aſſerted, <hi>They ſhall not hunger nor thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for he that hath mercy on them, ſhall lead them, even by the ſprings of water ſhall he guide them.</hi> To which thoſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are parallel, Joh. 6. 35. <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me ſhall never thirſt:</hi> which doctrine of his is yet amplified and enlarged in Joh. 7. 38. <hi>he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> What greater ſecurity from thirſt can be deſired, than that one ſhould be led by ſprings of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? yes, one may be led by the ſprings of water, and yet not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to drink of them: well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to put all out of fear, the godly ſoul ſhall contain <hi>within himſelf</hi> a ſpring of water, he ſhall have rivers of living waters in himſelf; and for his fuller ſecurity, theſe rivers ſhall be <hi>ever flowing</hi> too. It ſhall ſuffice at preſent, thus briefly to have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht this concluſion. And now having lapt up the meaning of the words in this ſhort poſition, I ſhall endeavour to unfold it in theſe ſix following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:103119:132"/>1. <hi>There is a raging thirſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul of man after ſome ultimate and ſatisfactory good.</hi> The God of nature hath implanted in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature a ſecret but powerful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency towards a centre, which dictates ariſing out of the very conſtitution of it, it cannot diſobey, untill it ceaſe so be ſuch, and utterly apoſtatize from the ſtate of its Creation. And the nobles any Being is, the more excellent is the object aſſigned unto it, and the more ſtrong, and potent, and uncontrollable are its raptures and motions thereunto. Wherefore the ſoul of man muſt needs alſo have its own proper centre, which muſt be ſomething ſuperiour to, and more excellent than itſelf, able to fill up all its indigencies, to match all its capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, to maſter all its cravings, and give a plenary and perfect ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which therefore can be no other than uncreated goodneſs, even God himſelf. It was not poſſible that God ſhould make man of ſuch faculties, and thoſe of that capaciouſneſs as we ſee them, and appoint any thing below
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103119:133"/> himſelf, to be his ultimate happineſs. Now although it be ſadly true, that the faculties of this ſoul are miſerably maimed, depraved, benighted, diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet I do not ſee that the ſoul is utterly unnatured by ſin, ſo as that any other thing ſhould be obtruded upon it for its centre and happineſs, than the ſame infinite good that was from the beginning ſuch, or ſo as that its main and cardinal motions ſhould be ultimately directed to any other than its natural and primitive object. The natural underſtanding hath not indeed any clear or diſtinct ſight of this bleſſed object, but yet it retains a darker and more general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of him, and may be ſaid even in all its purſuits of other things, to be ſtill <hi>groping in the dark</hi> after him: neither is it without ſome ſecret and latent ſenſe of God, that the will of man chooſeth or embraceth any thing for good. The Apoſtle ſticks not to affirm that the idolatrous <hi>Athenians</hi> themſelves did worſhip God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 23. though at that time indeed they <hi>knew not what</hi> they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103119:133"/> their worſhip was ſecretly and implicitly directed unto God, and did ultimately reſolve itſelf into him, though they were not aware of it—<hi>whom ye ignorantly worſhip, Him declare I unto you;</hi> now that he declared God unto them, appears abundantly by the following verſes, what he ſayes in point of worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame methinks I may ſay in point of love, truſt, delight, dependance, and apply it to all ſorts of Idolaters, as well as image-worſhipers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the covetous <hi>idolater</hi> even when he moſt fondly huggs his bags, and moſt firmly confideth in his riches, doth ignorantly <hi>love</hi> and <hi>truſt in</hi> God; the <hi>proud idolater</hi> in the higheſt acts of ſelf-ſeeking, and ſelf-pleaſing, doth ignorantly <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> God; the <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous idolater</hi> even in the hotteſt chaſe of ſecular glory, and popular applauſe, doth ignorantly <hi>purſue,</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> God. For that <hi>Reſt, Contentment, peace, happineſs, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> which theſe miſtaken ſouls
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103119:134"/> do aim at, what is it other than God, though they attribute it to ſomething elſe which cannot afford it, and ſo commit a real blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? For they that do in their hearts and courſe of their lives aſcribe a <hi>Filling</hi> and <hi>ſaisfying vertue</hi> to rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, pleaſures or honours, do as <hi>truly</hi> though not ſo <hi>loudly</hi> blaſpheme, as they who cryed out concerning the Calf of Gold, Exod. 32. 4. <hi>Theſe be thy Gods O Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. And in this ſenſe that I have been ſpeaking, one may ſafely affirm that the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the world doth <hi>ſecretly</hi> purſue the God whom he <hi>openly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whileſt his will is catching at that which his judgement renounceth, and he allows that <hi>piety</hi> in his luſts which he will not own in Heaven. The Hypocrite <hi>profeſſes to know God, but in works denies him;</hi> on the other hand the Atheiſt, <hi>though in words he deny God, yet in his works he profeſſeth him:</hi> ſo natural and neceſſary it is for all men to acknowledge a Deity, though ſome are ſo brutiſh and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103119:134"/> as to confine him to their own bellies; of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Phil. 3. 19. <hi>Whoſe God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is their belly.</hi> I ſay <hi>natural,</hi> for it is not only ſome few men of better education, and more contemplative complexions that hunt after this inviſible and ſatisfying good, but indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Certainly the motions of a ſoul are more ſtrong and weighty than we are ordinarily aware of; and I think one may ſafely conclude, that if there were no latent ſenſe or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſcience of God, the poor man could not ſpend the powers of his ſoul ſo intenſely for the purchaſing a little food and raiment for the body, nor the covetous man ſo inſatiably thirſt after houſes and land, and a larger heap of refined earth: Did they not ſecretly imagine, I mean, ſome Contentment, Happineſs, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction were to be drunk in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe acquirements, they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103119:135"/> would ſeem to be but dry and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid morſels to a ſoul; which ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate happineſs and ſatisfaction, as I ſaid before, can be no other than God himſelf, whom theſe miſtaken ſouls do ignorantly adore, and feel for in the dark. Neither let any one think that this ignorant and unwary purſuit of God can paſs for Religion or be acceptable in the ſight of God: for as it is impoſſible that ever any man ſhould ſtumble into a happy ſtate, without foreſight and free choice, and be in it without any kind of ſenſe or feeling of it, ſo ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103119:138"/> all they are, and do, to the latter; but alas it is not yet agreed among men, who are ſuch; the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> is grented, but the <hi>theſis</hi> is diſputed; and indeed this is no wonder neither, for it is as natural for the animal <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life</hi> to ſhift off guilt as it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it, and the <hi>pride</hi> of the natural man is no leſs conſpicuous in his wrongfull endeavours to ſeem inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of what he is indeed guilty, than his <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>voluptuouſneſs</hi> is apparent in the matter wherein his guilt conſiſteth. It is not only theſe and ſome few of the greateſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſt ſort of ſouls, that are guilty in this kind which I have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, (though they indeed are groſly and moſt viſibly guilty,) but verily the whole generation of meer animal men, who have no principle of divine life implanted in them, do ſpend all their <hi>dayes,</hi> beſtow all their <hi>pains,</hi> and enjoy all their <hi>comforts</hi> in a real ſtrain of blaſphemy, from firſt to laſt. What a blaſphemous kind of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly placed the ſupream good and

And indeed all thoſe kinds of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which placed it elſewhere in things below God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the enjoyment of him, were no leſs prophane, though they may ſeem ſomewhat leſs beaſtly. For whether the <hi>Epicureans</hi> idolized their own ſenſes, or the more exalted <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> deified their own faculty, placing their main contentment in their <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency</hi> and the perpetual ſerenity and tranquility of their own minds, it is too apparent that both the one and the other ſtill moved within the narrow and low ſphere of natural <hi>ſelf,</hi> and graſped after a Deity in the poor dark ſhadows, and glimmering repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of him. But I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> and amongſt theſe let no man tell me how orthodox his opinions, how pure and ſpiritual his forms, how numerous and ſpecious his performances are, how rightly he pays his homage, and prayes to one living God, by one living Mediator; I will willingly allow, and do with delight obſerve theſe things where ever they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103119:139"/> are; but yet all this doth not deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a Chriſtian: For ſtill that of the Apoſtle muſt hold good, Rom. 6. 16. <hi>His ſervants ye are, to whom ye obey;</hi> and I may adde by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a like phraſeologie, <hi>His children ye are whom ye reſemble,</hi> His creatures ye are (as far as you can make your ſelves ſo) whoſe ſufficiency and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty is moſtly magnified in your hearts, His worſhippers ye are whom ye moſtly love, truſt in, delight in, depend upon; in a word, That is your God, which your ſoul doth mainly reſt, and centre, and wrap up itſelf in.

This is as true an Antichriſt in the <hi>myſterie,</hi> as there is any <hi>literal</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in the world; and of this one may as truly ſay, as St. <hi>John</hi> doth of the other <hi>all the world wandereth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beaſt.</hi> In a word then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>No man can find that happineſs, and ſoul-filling ſatisfaction in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-enjoyment, which every natural man principally ſeeketh therein.</hi> Here are two things to be ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>enjoyments</hi> of men, or what they poſſeſs, and the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> which the natural man ſceketh in ſuch poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. For the firſt of theſe, I do not eaſily believe that ever any natural man had his fill of ſuch poſſeſſions, I mean as to the quantity of them; he never had ſo much of them, as to be able freely to ſay, <hi>It is enough.</hi> The rational ſoul hath a ſtrong and inſatiable appetite, and whereſoever it imagineth its beloved prey to be found, and filling enjoyment to be bad, it is exceeding greedy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whether the ſame will ever be able to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103119:140"/> afford it or no, it matters not. The <hi>animal life</hi> is that voracious idol, not like <hi>Bell</hi> in the ſtory which ſeems only to eat up, but which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally devour all the far morſels, and ſenſual pleaſures that are ſacrificed unto it, and yet is not filled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The whole employment of the natural man <hi>quantum, quantum eſt,</hi> is nothing elſe, but as the Apoſtle ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribes it, Rom. 13. 14. <hi>To make proviſions for the fleſh, to fulfil it in the luſts thereof:</hi> wherein yet to ſpeak the truth, he loſes his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for he ſacrifices all to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfiable idol, and powers it into a gulf that hath neither bottom nor bounds, but ſwalloweth up all into its barren womb, and is rather made to thirſt, than to ceaſe from thirſting by all that is or can be adminiſtred unto it. I take that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 8. to be a clear proof in general of what I affirm, <hi>the eye is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſeeing, nor the ear filled with hearing;</hi> the eye of man, as little as it is, is bigger than the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable world, which although it may
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103119:140"/> be wearied with looking upon vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous objects, as the <hi>Engliſh Annotators</hi> obſerve upon theſe words, yet ſtill deſires new ones, and can drink them in without ſurfeiting: ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>acts</hi> of the eye be ſcant and finite, yet the <hi>luſts</hi> of the eye ſeem to have a kind of infinity in them. And indeed by the unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the eye and care, is meant, the greedineſs or voracity of the fleſh or animal life, as Mr <hi>Cartwright</hi> hath well obſerved upon, Prov. 27. 20. <hi>Hell and deſtruction are never full, ſo the eyes of a man are never ſatisfied;</hi> where by not being ſatisfied is meant not having enough in quantity, as appears by the ſimilitude in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verſe. To the ſame ſenſe he ſpeaks, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 8. and 5. 10. It would be endleſs to relate the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and inexpleble gapings of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, ambitious, voluptuous, proud, vain-glorious minds after their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive idols. And indeed I need not deſcend to particular inſtances, for I ſuppoſe never any natural man could heartily ſay he had enough of riches,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103119:141"/> promotions, applauſe, ſenſual delights, eloquence, policy, proweſs or victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or of any other thing which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the gratification of the fleſh, no more than any godly ſoul ſojourning upon earth could ever be yet able to ſay he had enough of God and eternal life. So that in a word, I know not how to apply any deſcription to this inſatiable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring principle more properly than that which the Prophet makes of hell, <hi>Iſa. 5. 14. She enlargeth her ſelf and openeth her mouth without meaſure, and all glory, multitude and pomp deſcend into it.</hi> I know there are of theſe men that pretend to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in quantity of theſe fleſhly proviſions; but I fear falſly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly: For as for the rich and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of the earth, it is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they are ſtill climbing higher, and graſping after more, as the great <hi>Alexander</hi> is ſaid to have whined after more world, when he conceited himſelf to be maſter of all this; as for the poorer and meaner ſort of people who are as ready ſometimes
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103119:141"/> to lay claim to this vertue of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to have enough, as any other people whatſoever, it is too manifeſt to a wiſe obſerver that it is not a reall apprehenſion that they have enough, but either a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs of ſpirit ariſing from the meanneſs of their education, or a down right deſpair of ever get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more.</p>
            <p>But be it imagined that the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome natural men are enough in reſpect of quantity, yet ſtill there is certainly wanting a true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of ſoul in ſuch poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; no man of all theſe findes that real happineſs in thoſe things which he ſo vehemently hunteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Solomon</hi> reduces all of pleaſure and contentment that is to be found in multiplyed riches to a very pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>ſumma totalis,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 11. <hi>what good is there to the owners thereof, ſave the beholding of them with their eyes?</hi> And alas what is the ſight of the eye to the ſatisfaction of the ſoul! The whole conſpicable world is utterly too ſcant for and incommenſurate to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103119:142"/> the wide and deep capacity of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſpirit; ſo that the ſame can no more ſatisfie, than a leſs can fill a greater, which is ſurely impoſſible. Whatever is in the world out of God is deſcribed by the Prophet. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. to be <hi>not bread,</hi> there is the <hi>unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs;</hi> and <hi>not to ſatisfie,</hi> there is the <hi>inſufficiency</hi> of it as to the ſoul of man: on the other hand this ſoul of man is ſo vaſtly capacious, that though it be alſo never ſo greedy and rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, <hi>ſnatehing on the right hand</hi> and <hi>catching on the left hand</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet deſcribes the famelick people, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. 20. yet ſtill it is <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>unſatisfied.</hi> Which ravenous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable appetite of the ſenſual ſoul, is elegantly deſcribed by the Prophet in the ſimilitude of an <hi>whoriſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who proſtituted her ſelf to all comers, and <hi>multiplyeth her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> yet is <hi>unſatiable, is not, cannot be ſatisfied,</hi> Ezek. 16. 28, 29. The ſoul may indeed feed, yea and ſurfet upon, but it can never ſatisfie itſelf from itſelf, or from any created good: nothing can ultimately determine and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103119:142"/> centre the motions of a ſoul, but ſomething ſuperiour to its own eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; which whileſt it miſſes of, it is as it were divided againſt itſelf, perpetually ſtrugling and fluctuating, and travelling in pangs with ſome new deſign or other to be at reſt; like the old <hi>Lioneſs</hi> in the parable of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> breeding up one whelp after an other, to be a Lion wherein to confide, but diſappointed in all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Neither the quantity, variety or duration of any created objects can poſſibly fill up that large and noble capacity wherewith God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed the rational ſoul, but having departed from its centre and not knowing how to return to its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,

There are more ſtrong motions and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful appetites in the godly ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its true and proper happineſs, than in the ungodly and wicked.

We have already ſeen, that every unſanctified ſoul is reſtleſs, and creaving, wavering, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, inconſtant to it ſelf, and its
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103119:146"/> choice: By reaſon of its natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, it is alwaies ſpending it ſelf in reſtleſs and giddy motions, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved under the firſt head of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but by reaſon of its igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and <hi>unacquaintedneſs</hi> with the one, Supreme and All-ſufficient good, and the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of lower ends and objects, is miſerably diſtracted, and doth neceſſarily grapple with inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſturbances, in a continual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſs, putting forth it ſelf now towards one thing, anon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, courting every thing, but matching with nothing, like a <hi>fickle Lover</hi> that is alwaies enamoured with the laſt feature he ſaw, or a <hi>greedy Merchant,</hi> that being equally in love with the pleaſure of being at home, and the profit of being abroad, can ſtay long no where with any content, but has alwaies moſt mind of the place where he is not, as he confeſſes of himſelf in the Poet,</p>

            <p>The deſcription that our Lord gives

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103119:147"/> was going to ſpeak of, with the greater ſtrengeh and clearer evidence. The caſe ſtanding thus with the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſoul, as we have ſeen in this ſhort review, I now ſay that divine grace allays the multifarious thirſt of the ſoul after other waters, filthy puddles, of which it could never yet drink deep; or if it drunk never ſo deep, could not be quenched; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the ſoul to one object, which before was rent in pieces amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It do's not deſtroy any of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers, nor dry up the innate v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gour of the ſoul, as I made evident under the laſt head, but it takes it off from the chaſe of all inferiour ends, and inadequate objects, ſetting it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a vehement purſuit of, and cauſing it to ſpend all thoſe its powers not leſs vlgorouſly, but far more rationally and ſatisfactorily upon that <hi>objectum par amori,</hi> the infinitely-amiable and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient God.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103119:148"/> fraud or force, through ſurprize or violence, yet I will not proſtitute my ſelf unto you. The gracious foul hath now diſcovered the moſt beautiful, perfect, and lovely object, even him whoſe name is <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf; which glorious viſion hath ſo blaſted and withered the choiceſt flowers in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Garden, that they have now no more form nor comelineſs, beauty or fragrancy, as to deſerve to be deſired; ſhe hath taſted the pure and perfect ſweetneſs of the <hi>fountain,</hi> which hath ſo imbittered all <hi>ciſtern-waters,</hi> that ſhe finds no more thirſtings in her ſelf after them; which is chat which our Saviour promiſeth here—<hi>ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver chriſt.</hi> A godly ſoul cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fibly be put off with any thing ſhort of God; give him his God or he dies: Give him never ſo much fair uſage in the world never ſo much of earthly accommodations, they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to his wants and thirſts, if they have not that God in them, out of whom all worldly pleaſures are even irkſome and unpleaſant, and all fleſhly caſe is tedious and painſul:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103119:149"/> Creature-employments are but a weatiſome Crudgery to a ſoul that is acquainted with the work of Angels; and creature-enjoyments in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered, are very inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, if not burdenſome to a mind that is feelingly poſſeſt of the chiefeſt good.</p>
            <p>But here it will be ſeaſonable to take into conſideration, a grand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <hi>viz.</hi> whether a godly man may not be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to deſire the creature, and how far ſuch a perſon may be ſaid to thirſt after it. This I ſhall ſpeak to as briefly, and yet as clearly as I can, in theſe four follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All godly ſouls are not equally mortified to worldly loves, nor equally zealous and importunate lovers of God.</hi> This is ſo evident <hi>de facto,</hi> that I need not inſiſt upon it. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeems to have been as much higher and nobler in ſpirit than his Brother <hi>Lot,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> was more excellent than one of the ordinary Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid, than one of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> amongſt whom he dwelled.

               </gap>neſs to break up houſe, and quit his preſent habitation, rather than interfere with the conveniences of his Nephew, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 9. The other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a fruitful ſoil before a faithful ſociety, and ſo in ſome ſenſe his body before his ſoul; and yet as if it had not been enough to make ſo unadviſed a choice, he reſts in it too; yea though he was ſo ſeverely reproved by the captivity that befell him there, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was not ſo much call'd, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed carried away thence; yet this will not looſen him from his earthly conveniences, but he returns to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and from thence he will not part till he be fired out, nay and then alſo it is with much <hi>lingring</hi> and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 16. It is evident, I
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103119:150"/> ſay, <hi>de facto,</hi> both from this, and many other inſtances which I purpoſely omit, that it is ſo, that all godly ſouls are not equally careleſs of theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, not carried out with equal ardour and intemperance (as I may call it) towards the ſupreme and moſt glorious object, of which I can aſſign no fitter reaſon than this, becauſe they are not all equally godly. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>So far as grace prevails, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the power of is acteth the ſoul in which it is planted, ſo far earthly loves decay and wither.</hi> For theſe two cannot ſtand together, <hi>mutuo ſe pellunt,</hi> the love of the world is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the love of God, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 15. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> So far as any ſoul is <hi>ſanctified,</hi> ſo far is it <hi>mortified</hi> alſo to all creature-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to all things that are only fuel for the animal life, <hi>honour, eaſe, victory, plenty, liberty, relations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,</hi> all the entertainments and delights in this lower life, yea and this very life it ſelf. Earthly and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loves, are to each other, as the two
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103119:150"/> ends of a pair of ballances (ſave that they are never found equally poizing) as the one riſes, the other falls; juſt ſo much advantage as this gets, that loſes. The more the ſenſual and ſelf-central life thrives and proſpers, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is exalted, the more Religion and the divine life fainteth and flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſoul: And ſo certainly on the other hand, the more divine grace prevails, and the divine life flouriſheth in the ſoul, the more all earthly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wither away and loſe their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſoul cooleth and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as to its love and deſire of them. So far as a regenerate ſoul is unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ſo far ſhe will be bufling after other Lovers: which regeneration will not. I conceive, be throughly perfected, and therefore theſe luſtings not utterly extinguiſhed, till this mortal put on immortality; or as the Apoſtle ſpeaks elſewhere; till <hi>mortality be ſwallowed up of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For the preventing of raſh and uncharitable judging, I do affirm, that <hi>divine and holy ſouls are oft miſtaken by them that behold their ordinary converſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103119:151"/> and actions in the body:</hi> They are thought ſometimes to take pleaſure in the creature, and to gratifie the fleſh, when indeed it is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but they take pleaſure in the ſtamp of God, or the evidence of his fatherly love, which they contemplate therein, and do perhaps moſt of all ſerve a ſpiritual end, and an eternal deſign in thoſe very actions which others may think are calculated for the gratification of the animal life, and the ſervice of the fleſh. Let not the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind world, nor the ſelf-befriending hypocrite be judge, and it will appear that the truly godly ſoul counts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſavoury to it ſelf, but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents, teaches, exhibits ſomething of God, nothing pleaſant but what hath a tendency to him: Such a ſoul doth not <hi>feel</hi> himſelf in his higheſt raptures, doth not <hi>taſt</hi> himſelf in his nobleſt accompliſhments, doth not <hi>ſeek</hi> himſelf in his moſt excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: be nor miſtaken, he doth not ſo much thirſt after long life, riches, friends, liberties, as indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God in them all; theſe all ſignifie
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103119:151"/> nothing to him, if they bring him not nearer to his God, and conduce to his real and ſpiritual happineſs. Yea, poſſibly in his moſt ſuſpicable actions, and thoſe that ſeem moſt alien from Religion, and moſt deſigned to pleaſe the fleſh, he may be highly ſpiritual and pure: So was our bleſſed Saviour we know even in his converſing with ſcandalous ſinners, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Publicans and notorious o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, however he was traduced by a proud and hypocritical generation; and ſo I doubt not is many a good Chriſtian, according to his meaſure, pure as Chriſt was pure. When a paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hypocrite, who can gueſs a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the temper of others, no other way but by what he finds in himſelf, and by what he ſhould be and do if he were under the ſame circumſtances, comes to be Judge of the actions or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one who is transformed into the Image of the divine freedom and benignity, you may eaſily imagine what a perverſe ſentence he will paſs. It needs not ſeem very ſtrange, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, in ſpirituals, no more than it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103119:152"/> is in corporals, that the moſt ſound and healthful conſtitutions ſhould (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a lawful call) adventure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves further that the crazy, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and familiarly converſe with and handle, yea and make good work with thoſe briars and thorns, which would prove a ſnare, or a wound, or a pricking temptation to others. If it were poſſible for any man to arrive at the purity and perfection of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his firm and immoveable radication in true goodneſs, he would find himſelf ſo wholly dead to ſin, and all temptations, and motions thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that he would be able to dare to walk upon the moſt boiſterous waves, without fear of bring ſwallowed up in them, and to take up in his hands the moſt venemous Serpent, not dreading the ſting of it. However, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and actions of more perfect and more refined ſouls are not raſhly to be judged; for they may eaſily be miſtaken, either by the <hi>unhallowed hypocrite,</hi> or the more imperfect and <hi>impotent Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To anſwer yet more fully, I do
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103119:152"/> affirm, that <hi>no truly religious ſoul in the world doth ſo thirſt after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to place his main happineſs in it, or to ſeek ſatisfaction from it.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all holy ſouls may not be alike weaned from the world, nor equally loving of God, however the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions of ſome may really be, and of others may ſeem to be too groſs and fleſhly, yet no one of all theſe, in whom this new and divine life is indeed found, doth erect a <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupremacy</hi> in his own ſoul, nor take his full and compleat reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conſiſt in any creature-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion whatſoever. Surely this of <hi>not thirſting,</hi> is ſo far a conſequent of true Religion, as that no religious ſoul in the world can be content to exchange the preſence of God, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him for any thing, for all things beſides; or if you will, plainly thus, no ſuch perſon could be content, no not for all the world, (the glory of Heaven not excepted, if it may be ſuppoſed) to be wicked and ungodly: So that by thirſting here, muſt not be meant ſome weak wiſhings and fainter
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103119:153"/> propenſions of the ſoul towards crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted objects (for certainly there is no ſoul found in a body of earth, in which theſe are not found) no not yet ſome more lively and ſtronger ſtruglings after them (how ſtrong they may be in a good Chriſtian, and yet predominated over by grace, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not punctually determine;) but by thirſting, here muſt be meant the moſt quick and powerful breathings, the higheſt and ſtrongeſt ardencies, the predominant and victorious motions and deſires of the ſoul, which do as it were fold up the whole ſoul, and lead all its powers and faculties with it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a grateful captivity. Thus ſhall be thirſt no more, who hath once drunk of theſe waters which flow forth from the preſence of the Lord of life, and which the bleſſed Rodeemer of the world is here ſaid to give.</p>
            <p>But (which is the latter branch of this particular) this inſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red ſoul which we have been deſcribing, thir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ech after his happineſs in God alone, that is, in the enjoyment of him. We have already ſeen that grace do's not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103119:153"/> deſtroy the natural and eſſential long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſoul after a ſatisfactory good, but rather enhance them, and that the godly ſoul is moſt thirſty of all, but not with a creature-thirſt, as is before proved; it remains then that his thirſting after reſt and happineſs is terminated upon God alone. And ſo indeed it appears in the inſtances of holy men recorded in the holy Writ, which I have under the laſt head ſpoke ſomething to, and ſo partly prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf. But unto thoſe paſſages and profeſſions which I quoted out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2. &amp;c. You may add ſuch, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. which is the voice of every godly ſoul; <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us:</hi> Pſal. 39. 6, 7. <hi>Surely every man walketh in a vain ſhow; ſurely they are diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain; he heapeth up riches, &amp;c. And now Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee:</hi> Where you have the different ſeekings and centrings of the ungodly, and of the godly ſoul ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribed. Laſtly, you may in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. again view the term or end of the godly man's ambition; <hi>Whom
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103119:154"/> have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee!</hi> Which tranſlation of the words doth lively ſets out the godly man's end, and aim, and object, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and indeed his all: or if we tranſlate (perhaps more fitly) with <hi>Mollerus,</hi> yet they afford us the ſame doctrine, <hi>Who will give me to be in Heaven, and with thee? on earth I deſire nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have we diſpatcht the fifth Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the godly ſoul thirſteth no more after happineſs in any creature, or reſt in any worldly thing; and come to the ſixth and laſt particular deſigned for the explication of this <hi>not thirſting</hi> of the religious ſoul, which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the enjoyment of God this ſoul is at reſt, is fully ſatisfied.</hi> I do not mean ſo ſatisfied, as not ſo thirſt after any more of him, as I have often hinted, but ſo ſatisfied, <hi>as to be perfectly maicht with an object tranſcendently adequate to all its faculties, and their reſpective capacities;</hi> and ſo ſatisfied, <hi>as to have peace and joy, and triumph in him.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103119:154"/> two I will ſpeak ſomething to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and ſo paſs on.</p>
            <p>Now for the better underſtanding of the firſt of theſe, it ſhould be noted, <hi>That the reaſonable ſoul, and the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it are of a vaſt, large, and noble capacity.</hi> It is univerſally granted by all, that are not <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that the capacity of <hi>Angels</hi> is very great and noble, and that the condition of the humane ſoul is not much inferiour to it, may, I think, be gathered from the Pralmiſt's words, <hi>Pſal. 8. 5. Thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels:</hi> Which words, although the Auchor of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> applies to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 9. (And indeed, they have a marvelous aptneſs to him, according to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tranſlation, which runs thus, <hi>We ſee Jeſus crowned with glory and honour, who was become a little leſſer than the Angels, by reaſon of the ſuffering of death a that he ſhould by the grace of God &amp;c.</hi>) Yet I ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But, however it goes with that Text, and whether or no the ſouls of men be ſo near of kindred to the Angels, as to their comprechenſions; yet that they are capable of a moſt noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent happineſs, and much allyed to God himſelf, doth appear from ſuch texts of Scripture, as do require them to be <hi>holy, as God is holy,</hi> to be <hi>perfect,</hi> as their <hi>heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then need it ſeem to any incredible, that the rational ſoul ſhould be ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacions; for we are no more to judge of the Angelical temper, and noble actings of the ſeparated ſoul, by what

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From this conjunction with omnipotent goodneſs, ariſeth <hi>pure peace, yea joy and triumph</hi> to the religious ſoul. For the clearer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this, I ſhould premiſe, what ſome have wiſely obſerved, that <hi>there is a natural congruity between God and the ſoul,</hi> ſhe being a <hi>ſpiritual ſubſtance,</hi> and he being a <hi>ſpiritual good,</hi> only ſuitable unto her. This ſeems to be evident by experience; for we ſee how difficult, I had almoſt ſaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is, utterly to eradicate and extinguiſh all ſenſe of vertue and goodneſs out of the ſoul of man; to which purpoſe I think our Divines ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeak, when they allow of ſome <hi>holy relicks,</hi> ſomething of the Image of God remaining in the moſt degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſouls, however all men have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſame to a very poor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable <hi>ſpark,</hi> and many have raked that very ſpark under <hi>aſhes</hi> too, and <hi>impriſoned</hi> that remainder of <hi>truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> living according to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103119:157"/> thoſe unnatural and forreign principles and conceptions that they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily drunk in. Hence it is, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſin and wickedneſs are ſo often ſtiled the <hi>defilement</hi> of the ſoul: Now we know, that whatſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth, is adventitious and improper: And hence it is that ſin many times ſlings and wounds the conſciences of thoſe that take moſt pleaſure in it, namely, being ſo perfectly contrary to this noble and inbred ſenſe of the ſoul; allowing then this natural <hi>ſympathy</hi> that the ſoul of man hath with its Creator; it will be eaſie to give a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical</hi> account of that <hi>peace, joy</hi> and <hi>triumph,</hi> of which the ſoul muſt needs be poſſeſt, or rather indeed tranſported with, that finds and feels it ſelf in conjunction with its centre, &amp; in the deareſt embraces of its Creator. It need not ſeem ſtrange that the ſoul ſhould mightily congratulate it ſelf in its arrival at its own haven; nay, it were ſtrange if it ſhould not diſſolve into ſecret joy and pleaſure in the hearty entertainments of ſo bleſſed and proper a gueſt as God is unto it:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103119:157"/> Nay, indeed it were unreaſonable to imagine, that the conjunction of ſo noble and diſcerning faculties, with ſo perfect and proper an object, ſhould not beget the trueſt and ſincereſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure imaginable. The delights of an earthly and ſenſual mind, are filthy and dreggy, in compariſon of theſe pleaſures of the refined and purified ſoul, which muſt needs live moſt gracefully, triumphantly, and deliciouſly, when it converſeth with God moſt intimately. Certainly if there be any innocent and well-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd <hi>ſelf-feeling,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-pleaſing</hi> in the world, this is it; though indeed, to ſpeak truly, it deſerves a better name. It cannot be but that a godly ſoul, being in its right ſenſes, ſhould taſt a ſweetneſs in theſe pure and divine accompliſhments wrought in it by the eternal Spirit of Righteouſneſs; which ſelf-pleaſing is no more blameable, than that natural pleaſure, which every creature finds in the enjoyment of that which is moſt aptly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to its neceſſities, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of its happineſs; which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103119:158"/> I ſay, ariſeth in the ſoul from its ſenſible union with God in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and enjoyment of him: By which <hi>enjoyment of God,</hi> you will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I do not mean the bare par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, or an abſtract Juſtification; (for this is not the attainment that is perfective of the ſoul, neither could it alone (if we could ſuppoſe it alone) fill up the capacities of the ſoul, or make it happy, however the raptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous joys of the unprincipled hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite ſpring principally from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and falſe apprehenſion of this; which indeed I take to be a notable (though not infallible) ſign of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, low-ſpirited, and fleſhly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Chriſtian:) but by it I mean the ſouls being really regenerated into the Image of God, conſiſting in <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs,</hi> and her implantation into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet beſides this, I conceive there is a more <hi>Theological</hi> account to be given of theſe joys and pleaſures which the renewed ſoul doth ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103119:158"/> reap, upon her return to God, from whom ſhe had ſo long ſtraggled by ſin and wickedneſs. For the <hi>God of hope filleth</hi> the godly ſoul <hi>with all peace and joy in believing,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. Chriſt doth on purpoſe ſpeak words to the hearts of his Diſciples, that their <hi>joy may be full,</hi> Joh. 15. 11. But whether the moſt benign and gracious Father of ſpirits doth immediately from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſpire the holy ſoul, with divine joys and pleaſures, kindled, as I may ſay, with nothing but his own breath; or whether he bring them to his <hi>holy Mountain,</hi> and into his <hi>houſe of prayer,</hi> and by that or any other the like means make them <hi>joyful,</hi> and of glad heart, as in the day of a ſolemn feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, as he hath promiſed to do, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 7. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. However it be, I ſay, ſure it is that he frequently puts a gladneſs into their hearts beyond that of the Harveſt or the Vintage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 7. and makes them to rejoyce with <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>

Oh what pitty is it that the precious ſouls of men, yea and of Chriſtians, the beſt of men, that are all capable of ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty, ſo high and honourable a happineſs, ſhould be bound down under ſuch vile and ſordid luſts, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon duſt and gravel to whom the

With what face can we pretend to true Religion, or a feeling acquaintance with God and the things of his perſonall ſervice and Kingdome, whileſt the continual <hi>bleatings</hi> and <hi>lowings</hi> of our ſouls after created good, do bewray us ſo manifeſtly, and proclaim before all the world, that the <hi>beaſt,</hi> the brutiſh life, is ſtill powerful in us? <hi>If ye ſeek me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his followers, as well as he did once to his perſecutors, <hi>then let theſe go;</hi> let go the hold of theſe earthly objects, let vaniſh theſe worldly joys and toys, <hi>with-hold your throat from thirſt, and your feet from being unſhod,</hi> and come follow me only, and ye ſhall have treaſure in Heaven; for he that will not deny all for me, is not worthy of

By <hi>perfection</hi> I do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from the beſt ſtate, which the beſt men upon earth can poſſibly be in. So then I take Eternal Life in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103119:163"/> the primary and moſt proper notion of it to be full and perfect, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enjoyment of God, communion with him, and a moſt bliſsful confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of all the powers and faculties of the ſoul to that eternal goodneſs, truth, and love, as far as it is, or may become capable of the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the divinity. This life was at the higheſt rate imaginable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by our ever bleſſed Lord and Saviour in the daies of his fleſh, and here in the Text promiſed to every believing ſoul. Now, in as much as we are ignorant both of the preſent capacity of our own faculties, how large they are, and much more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how much more large and ample they may be made, on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the more rich and plentiful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of the divine life and image, therefore can we not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend neither the tranſcendent life, happineſs and glory, nor that degree of ſanctity and bleſſedneſs which the believing ſoul may be advanced unto in another world. The Popiſh School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do nicely diſpute about the <hi>ſight
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103119:163"/> of God,</hi> and the <hi>love of God,</hi> to wit, in whether of theſe the formal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoul conſiſteth, ill ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating thoſe whom God hath ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned together; as if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that either a <hi>blind love,</hi> or a je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june and <hi>unaffectionate ſpeculation</hi> could render a ſoul entirely happy: But it is much ſafer to ſay, that the happineſs and eternal life of the ſoul, ſtandeth in the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> or <hi>fruition</hi> of God; and this doth neceſſarily import the proper perfection of every faculty. Nothing can be the <hi>formal happineſs</hi> of a ſpirit that is either <hi>iuferiour</hi> or <hi>extrinſecal</hi> to it; it muſt be ſomething divine, and that wrought into the very nature and temper of it, I doubt not to affirm that if the ſoul of man were poſſibly advanced, ſo as to receive adoration or <hi>divine power,</hi> yet if it were in the mean time void of <hi>divine diſpoſitions,</hi> and a god-like nature; it were far from being glorified, and made happy as to its capacity. What <hi>health</hi> is to the body, that is <hi>holineſs</hi> to the ſoul; which happily the Apoſtle alludes to, when he ſpeaks of the <hi>ſpirit of a ſound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7.</p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:103119:164"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is another notion of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> (which ſome contend for) by which they mean not barely the eſſential happineſs of the ſoul, but <hi>that with the addition of many ſuitable and glorious circumſtances,</hi> the eſſential happineſs of the ſoul, as it is attended with the appendixes of a glorified body <hi>the beholding of Chriſt, the amicable ſociety of Angels, freedom from temptations, the knowledge of the ſecrets of nature and providence,</hi> and ſome ſuch like: To which may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo added (though of a lower degree) <hi>open abſolution,</hi> or a <hi>viſible deliverance of the Saints out of the overthrow of the wicked, at the conflagration of the world, power over Devils, eminence of place, enjoyment of friends,</hi> and ſome other like. Now let us briefly conſider what tendencies there are in the religious ſoul towards each of theſe: And here I muſt crave leave to ſpeak joyntly both of the <hi>End,</hi> and of the <hi>Motion</hi> thereunto; though it may be thought that the former only falls fairly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our preſent conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then I ſuppoſe that <hi>Eternal
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103119:164"/> Life</hi> in the firſt ſenſe of it, is intended here, to wit, the <hi>eſſential happineſs</hi> of the ſoul, or its perfect and everlaſting enjoyment of God. For the deſcription is here made of Religion it ſelf in the <hi>abſtract,</hi> or that principle of divine life, which Chriſt Jeſus implanteth in the ſoul; and being ſo conſidered, it is hard to conceive how that ſhould ſpring up into any of theſe appendant circumſtances, or into any thing but the completion and perfection of it ſelf; though the religious ſoul taken in the <hi>concrete,</hi> poſſibly may. And indeed, though we ſhould allow (which we ſhall take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the next head) that many of thoſe high ſcriptural phraſes which are brought to deſcribe the future condition of believing ſouls, do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpect the <hi>appendixes</hi> of its <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential happineſs</hi> (as <hi>a Kingdom, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, an inheritance reſerved, a place prepared,</hi> and the like) yet it ſeems very unnatural to interpret this phraſe, <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> any otherwiſe than of that which I call
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103119:165"/> the <hi>eſſential happineſs</hi> of the ſoul: But if we interpret it of this, the ſenſe is very fair and eaſie; thus, this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of divine life is continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to grow up to its juſt alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to advance it ſelf unto a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſtate, even as all other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of life do naturally tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a final accompliſhment, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate perfection. <hi>Carnal ſelf,</hi> or the animal life may be indeed ſaid to be a <hi>well of water too, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous water;</hi> but that ſprings up into a <hi>ſenſual life,</hi> popular applauſe, ſelf-accommodations; or if you will in the Apoſtles phraſe, into the <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> This I ſpeak only by way of illuſtratory oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for to ſpeak more properly, this corrupt principle hath in it the central force of death and Hell, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tumbling downward; whereas this divine principle is alwaies climbing upward: But they do both agree in this, that they do both ſeek their own gratifications, and ſtudy to acquire their reſpective perfections. The everlaſting and moſt glorious enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103119:165"/> of God is certainly moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of the ſoul; and therefore is moſt properly and moſt deſervingly ſaid to be its <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. Now this <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is not a thing <hi>ſpecifically</hi> different from <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>the image of God,</hi> or <hi>the divine life;</hi> but indeed <hi>the greateſt height,</hi> and <hi>the moſt poſſible perfection</hi> of it ſelf: even as the Sun at noon-day is not a light really diſtinct from what is was in the firſt dawnings of the morning, but a different degree, and far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate; which ſeems to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſimilitude whereby the Spirit of God illuſtrateth the matter in hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. Or as a man of perfect age is not a diſtinct <hi>ſpecies</hi> from a child, but much more compleat and excellent in that <hi>ſpecies;</hi> to which the Apoſtle refers, treating of this ſubject, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. Man hath not two diſtinct kinds of happineſs in the two diſtinct worlds that he is made to live in; but one and the ſame thing is his bleſſedneſs in both, which, as I ſaid before, muſt needs
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103119:166"/> be the enjoyment of God. The tranſlation made of the Text is very ſuitable to this notion; for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principle is ſaid to ſpring up, not <hi>unto,</hi> but <hi>into</hi> everlaſting life, <hi>q. d.</hi> it ſprings up till it be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into the perfect knowledge, love, and enjoyment of God: Even as youth is ſwallowed up in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſo this <hi>grace</hi> is ſwallowed up in <hi>glory,</hi> and not ſo much <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> as indeed <hi>perfected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this phraſe, the genius of true Religion, and the excellent temper of the true religious ſoul, is moſt lively deſcribed. This is the ſoul, that being in ſome meaſure deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its unnatural bondage, and freed from its unhappy confinement now ſpreads it ſelf in God, lifts up it ſelf unto him, ſtretches it ſelf upon him, is not content with a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meerly to come, but brings down Heaven into it ſelf, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up it ſelf unto, and after the God of Heaven. God is become great, only great in the eye of ſuch a Chriſtian; he is indeed become
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103119:166"/> 
               <hi>All things</hi> to him; whileſt this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is rightly and actually predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in him, he knows no <hi>intereſt</hi> but to thrive and grow great in God; no <hi>will,</hi> but to ſerve the will, and comply with the mind of God; no <hi>end,</hi> but to be united to God; no <hi>buſineſs,</hi> but to diſplay and reflect the glory and perfections of God upon the Earth; the main <hi>buſineſs</hi> of his life, I ſay, is to ſerve him, the main <hi>ambition</hi> of his ſoul to be like unto him, and his main <hi>happineſs</hi> in this world to be united to him, and in the world to come, to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in him, in this world to know, and love, and reſt, and delight in, and enjoy God <hi>more than all things,</hi> and in the world to come to enjoy him <hi>more than ſo.</hi> The gladſome growings up of the tender flowers unto the friendly Sun, being once powerfully ſurpriz'd with his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and benign influences, and the chearful haſt with which the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick needle ſo amorouſly purſues the inchanting loadſtone, being once rightly toucht and affected with it,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103119:167"/> do a little (though but a little) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and repreſent the motions of a ſpirit impregnated with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principle, and ſtrongly impreſt with the image and ſtamp of God: he puts in his hand by the hole of the door, and the bowels of the eſpouſed ſoul are preſently moved, yea, melted for him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4. He caſts the skirt of his garment, the mantle of his love, and preſently the converted ſoul leaves all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are knitting and ſpringing graces, and this <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is the end and perfection of them all; not that any one of them (I conceive) ſhall be utterly incaſſated and aboliſhed, as ſome conclude concerning the two former (though without good ground I think) from the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. But <hi>Faith</hi> will be ripened into the moſt firm and undiſturbed <hi>confidence, affiance,</hi> and <hi>acquieſcence</hi> in God, <hi>hope</hi> will be advanced into a more chearful, powerful, and confident <hi>expectation,</hi> having for its object the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103119:167"/> of the ſouls felicity; and <hi>love</hi> will become <hi>much more loving,</hi> and more clearly diſtinguiſhable from the imperfect longings and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this preſent ſtate, when it ſhall flower up into pure delights and complacencies, reſting and glorying in the arms of its adequate, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and eternal object. The faith of the hypocrite (and indeed his hope too) is ſtill ſpringing up into <hi>ſelf-preſervation, deliverance, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, a ſplendid and pompous ſtate of the Church</hi> (that is of his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) or ſome ſuch thing as will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the animal life, and there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates; but the faith of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and religious ſoul ſprings up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal life, it knows no term but <hi>the ſalvation of the ſoul,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 9. As his hope knows no accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment but a ſtate of <hi>god-like purity</hi> and perfection, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. The more natural man lives within himſelf, within a circle of his own, and cannot get out; whether he eat, or drink, or pray, or be zealous for the popular pulling down of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103119:168"/> Antichriſt, he is ſtill in his own circle, he is ſtill ſacrificing in all this to that great <hi>helluo</hi> the animal life, as I have already made evident: But the godly ſoul is diſintereſted of ſelf, and ſo is ſtill contriving the advancement of a nobler life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf, and moving towards God, as his ſupreme and all-ſufficient good. Give him all that the whole world can afford, he cannot fix, nor ſettle, nor centre here: God hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a holy reſtleſs appetite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a higher good, which he would rather be, than what he is. I know indeed that the ſoul that is thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely free, may be hindered in its flight; but it will deliver it ſelf from the clog at length: you may choak and damm up the ſtreamings of this fountain perhaps, but they will burſt out again; you may caſt aſhes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this pure fire for a time, but it will flame out again; ſuch a damp cannot ariſe, no not from Hell it ſelf, as to extinguiſh it. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, I remember, ſtopped the wells of water which <hi>Abraham</hi> had
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:103119:168"/> digged in <hi>Gerar, and filled them with earth,</hi> Gen. 26. 15. But this well of water which God diggeth in the holy and humble ſoul, cannot be ſtopped, neither by the Devil that King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> (that is, of <hi>wandrings) Job</hi> 1. 7. nor by any of his ſervants, but it will find vent upward: though you endeavour to fill it with earth, which indeed is the likelieſt to choak it, (for <hi>amor rerum terrena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt viſcus ſpiritualium pennarum</hi>) though you caſt duſt and gravel of earthly pleaſures, profits, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into it, yet it is a well of <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> water, and will work its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out. The hungrings of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoul are not, cannot be ſatisfied, till it come to feed upon the <hi>hidden Manna,</hi> nor its thirſtings quenched, till it come to be ſwallowed up in the unbounded Ocean of life and love.</p>
            <p>But I ſee I cannot divide <hi>ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up</hi> from <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the <hi>term</hi> of Religion, but I muſt alſo take in the <hi>motion</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſoul, whereby he purſues it,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103119:169"/> which I have already handled in my diſcourſe, therefore I will quit this head, and take a ſhort view of the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The ſecondary and more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of Eternal Life, I told you, was <hi>that which takes in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances or appendices of it.</hi> And here we muſt needs allow, that the holy Scriptures do openly avonch ſome of theſe circumſtances, as thoſe eſpecially of the firſt rank that I named, of ſome of which it ſeems to make great account; and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Scripture may ſome where or other imply all the reſt, even thoſe of the inferiour rank. Again, we will allow, that many of thoſe phraſes which the Scripture uſes to deſcribe the bleſſed ſtate of the other world, do principally reſpect theſe <hi>appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> of the ſouls eſſential happineſs: Such perhaps are the <hi>Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. The price of the high Calling,</hi> mentioned by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Phil. 3. 14. The Houſe which is from Heaven,</hi> ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103119:169"/> 
               <hi>A Kingdom, an incorruptible Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a place prepared, Manſions, a reward, praiſe, and honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7. And that <hi>glory, honour and peace</hi> ſpoken of by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. 10. Theſe are all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture deſcriptions of the other ſtate, and I ſuppoſe we may grant them to have a peculiar reference to this <hi>ſecondary</hi> and <hi>preter-eſſential</hi> happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoul: Though I know not any neceſſity there is to be ſo liberal in our conceſſions; for it may be fairly ſaid concerning all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or moſt of them, that the deſign of theſe phraſes, is not ſo much to eſtabliſh this leſs proper notion, or to point ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the circumſtances of the glorified ſtate, as to inſinuate how much more ample and glorious that ſtate ſhall be than this in which we now are; as a <hi>prize</hi> is looked upon as ſomewhat more excellent than what is done or expended to acquire it (it muſt needs be ſo eſteemed by runners and wreſtlers)
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103119:170"/> a <hi>Kingdom</hi> is a more glorious ſtate than that of <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and an <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> is incomparably more ample than the <hi>penſion</hi> that is allowed the heir in his minority.</p>
            <p>But theſe things being conceded, it doth not appear how far, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what notion the religious ſoul (as ſuch) doth ſpring up into theſe additional glories, and thirſt after them. I know there are many that ſpeak very highly of theſe appendices; and allow the godly ſoul a very high and irreſpective valuation of them: And this they do principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer from the examples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as alſo of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> Give me leave therefore to ſuggeſt ſomething, not to enervate, but to moderate the Argument drawn from theſe perſons, and after that I ſhall briefly lay down what I conceive to be moſt Scriptural and rational in this matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As for the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it ſeems to make not much for them in this matter. For however
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103119:170"/> the Text is very plain, that <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the croſs,</hi> and this joy ſeems plainly to be his <hi>ſeſſion at the right hand of God,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. Yet if by this <hi>joy</hi> we underſtand a more full and glorious poſſeſſion of God, and a more excellent exaltation of his humane nature, to a more free frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine, then it cannot be applied to any thing but the ſpringing up of the gracious ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its eſſential happineſs; which I have already contended for, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper genius of ſuch a ſoul; or if by this <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Throne</hi> we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the power that Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw he ſhould be veſted with of leading captivity captive, trampling under feet the powers of hell and darkneſs, and procuring gifts for men (which ſeems to me to be moſt likely) then it belongs not at all to men, neither can this example be drawn into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imitation.</p>
            <p>As for the inſtance of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who is ſaid to have had <hi>reſpect to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:103119:171"/> the recompence of the reward,</hi> Heb. 11. 26. It is not yet granted, that that <hi>recompence of reward</hi> relates principally to theſe appendants of the ſouls eſſential happineſs, neither can it, I ſuppoſe, be evinced: But, though I ſhould alſo allow that, (which I encline to do) yet all that can be inferred from it is but a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> had, as our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well renders it, or <hi>ſome account,</hi> which he in his ſufferings made of this recompence; which was a very war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable contemplation.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> indeed doth openly profeſs that he looked for, and deſired the coming of Chriſt from Heaven upon the account of that glorious body which he would then cloath him with, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21. And ſo he might ſure, and yet not deſire it <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>primarily,</hi> but <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> and with <hi>reference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this leads me to the general anſwer that I was preparing to give, which is this. Some of theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which I named, eſpecially
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103119:171"/> that of the <hi>glorified body,</hi> may be reduced to the <hi>eſſential happineſs</hi> of the ſoul, or included in it, ſo as that the ſoul could not otherwiſe be perfectly happy. It is the vote of all Divines I think, that a Chriſtian is not compleatly happy, till he conſiſt of a ſoul and body both glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. And indeed, conſidering the dear affection, and eſſential apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that God hath planted in the humane ſoul for a body, we cannot well conceive how ſhe ſhould be perfectly happy without one: And this earthly body is (alas) an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal yoak fellow, in which ſhe is half ſtifled, and rather <hi>buried</hi> than conveniently <hi>lodg'd;</hi> ſo that it ſeems neceſſary even to her eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial happineſs, that ſhe ſhould have ſome more heavenly and glorious body, wherein ſhe may commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and pleaſantly exert her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate powers, and whereby ſhe may expreſs her ſelf in a ſpiritual and noble manner ſuitable to her own natural dignity and vigour, and to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103119:172"/> her infinitely-amiable, and moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object.</p>
            <p>Concerning the reſt of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which cannot be thus reduced, I conceive that ſuch of them as are neceſſary to the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial happineſs of the ſoul <hi>by way of ſubſerviency,</hi> may be eyed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and thirſted after <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> and <hi>with reference,</hi> as I ſaid before, that is, under this notion only, as they are ſubſervient to that eſſential bleſſedneſs; I confeſs I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand under what other notion a religious ſoul can lift up it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I mean, not ſo far forth as it is holy and religious, and acts ſuitably to that divine principle which the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> or rather the <hi>Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath implanted in it. And if there be any other circumſtance which cannot be reduced to one of theſe kinds, I ſuppoſe it may be reckoned amongſt the objects and gratifications of the <hi>animal life,</hi> and not to make up any part of the godly man's <hi>Heaven,</hi> or

            <p>Wherefore as a reſult from the whole diſcourſe, eſpecially from this laſt part of it, let me earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat all the profeſſors of this holy Religion, which the bleſſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> Chriſt Jeſus hath ſo dearly bought for the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in it, not to value themſelves by any thing which the power of natural ſelf-love may exert or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, perform or expect, nor by any thing below the image of God, and the internal and transforming mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Chriſt Jeſus in them; the perfection of which is eternal life in the moſt proper and true no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of it, as you have heard.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:103119:176"/> hereafter. The ground of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe then ſhall be this ſhort and plain Propoſition. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A godly man hath communion with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the more diſtinct hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereof, I muſt premiſe a few things briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the gracious and loving God made nothing miſerable of all that he had made.</hi> There are no <hi>ſlaves</hi> born in his great <hi>houſe</hi> of the world. He made all things out of himſelf, and he hath no <hi>idea</hi> of evil in himſelf, ſo that it was not poſſible that he ſhould make any thing <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>miſerable.</hi> Every thing was <hi>good, Gen.</hi> 1. and ſo in ſome ſenſe <hi>happy.</hi> He was free to make the world, but making it, he could not make it evil or miſerable. Every thing is the product of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty love and goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The happineſs of every creature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in its acting agreeably to that nature that God gave it, and thoſe ends which he propounded to it, and ſuitably to thoſe laws which he gave them;</hi> which
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:103119:177"/> laws were contrived with the greateſt <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> to thoſe natures, and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency</hi> to thoſe ends. Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in its kind happy, whileſt it acts agreeably to that nature which the wiſe creator implanted in it; as the Sun runs its race without ceaſing, and rejoyces ſo to do, and is in ſome ſenſe happy in ſo doing. Departing from that nature it becomes miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the earth bringing forth <hi>briers</hi> and <hi>thorns</hi> inſtead of thoſe good fruits which it was appointed to bring forth, is ſaid to be <hi>curſed, Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The happineſs of the creature is higher or lower, greater or leſſer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it comes nearer to God, or is further off from him,</hi> according as it receives more or leſs from him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what communion it hath with him. The life and happineſs of the <hi>Sun</hi> is much lower than that of a <hi>man,</hi> becauſe it cannot enjoy ſuch high and excellent communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from, or communion with God as man doth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There can be no communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103119:177"/> likeneſs.</hi> The Sun ſhines upon a ſtone wall, as well as upon man, but a ſtone wall ha's no communion with the Sun, becauſe it hath no eyes to ſee the light of it as man hath, nor can receive the benign influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of its heat as the herbs do. A log of wood lyeth in the water as well as the Fiſh, but it hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the water, nor receives no advantage by it as the Fiſh doth. God is preſent (according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite eſſence) with the Devils as well as with the Angels, but they have no likeneſs in nature to him, and ſo no communion with him, as theſe have.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>God bath given a more large and excellent capacity to man, than to any other of his creatures upon earth.</hi> God hath endued man with reaſon, and ſo made him capable of a higher life, and a more excellent communion with his Maker than all the reſt. The rational ſoul of all ſublunary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is only capable to know, love, ſerve, enjoy, imitate God, and ſo to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:103119:178"/> have a glorious communion with him. The Sun in all its glory and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ſo excellent a Being as any ſoul of man upon this account. And although man by his fall loſt his <hi>actual</hi> communion with God, yet be is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature ſtill, he hath not loſt his <hi>capacity</hi> of receiving influences from him, and enjoying communion with him. The world when it is at the darkeſt, is yet capable of being enlightned.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>When the nature of man is by divine grace healed of its diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and reſtored to its former recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to act ſuitably to the end for which it was made, and to ſpend it ſelf upon its proper object, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:103119:178"/> and really converſe with him: when the ſpirit of God informs theſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſouls, and derives the ſtrength of a divine life through them, and ſtamps the lively impreſſions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections upon them, rendring our hearts, will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wayes conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that glorious pattern, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good, then do we enjoy a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per communion with him, and are <hi>truly</hi> bleſſed; though we are not <hi>compleatly</hi> bleſſed, till this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity be perfected according to what thoſe ſouls <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
            <p>This is the true and proper notion of mans communion with God; and relation to him, which we cannot fully <hi>deſcribe</hi> till we do more fully <hi>enjoy.</hi> That ſoul that truly lives and feeds upon God, do's <hi>taſte</hi> more than it can <hi>tell;</hi> and yet it can tell this, that this is the moſt high, excellent, noble, glorious life in the whole world.</p>
            <p>This communion, as alſo the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateneſs and cloſeneſs of it are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103119:179"/> variouſly in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, by the ſimilitude of <hi>members</hi> being in the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. Of <hi>branches</hi> being in the Vine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2. By being <hi>formed according to Gods image,</hi> Rom. 8. 29. <hi>Changed into his image,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. By Gods <hi>dwelling in the ſoul, and the ſoul in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. By Chriſts being <hi>formed</hi> in the ſoul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19: By the ſouls <hi>having</hi> Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. By Chriſts <hi>ſupping</hi> with the ſoul, and the ſoul with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. Becauſe nothing is more our <hi>own,</hi> nor more <hi>one</hi> with us, than that which we eat and drink, being incorporated into us; therefore is this ſpiritual communion between God and the godly ſoul oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture deſcribed by our <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> with him. Thus God was pleaſed to allow his people under the law, when they had offered up a part of their Beaſts in Sacrifice to him, to ſit down and feaſt upon the reſt, as a token of that familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and oneneſs that was between him and them. By the like action our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:103119:179"/> ſhadowed out the ſame myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, when in the Sacrament of his <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> he appointed them to ſit down and eat and drink with him, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their feeding upon him, and moſt cloſe communion with him: yea the ſtate of <hi>glory</hi> which is the moſt perfect communion with God, is thus ſhadowed out too, <hi>Mat. 8. 11. Rev.</hi> 19. 9. And which is worth noting, I think the Sacramental eating and drinking hath ſome reference to that moſt intimate communion of the Saints with God in glory: our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf ſeems to imply as much in that ſpeech of his, Luk. 22. 30. <hi>That ye may eat and drink at my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in my Kingdom:</hi> In which words he ſeems plainly to allude to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental eating and drinking which he had a little before inſtituted, <hi>viz. ver.</hi> 19. Which makes ſome to believe that that geſture is to be retained in that ordinance, which is moſt proper and uſual to expreſs familiarity and communion, and to take away that geſture, is to deſtroy one great end
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103119:180"/> of our Saviour in appointing this Supper, which was to repreſent that familiar communion which is between himſelf and every believing ſoul. I will not here examine the validity of their argument, which poſſibly if preſt home might introduce a rudeneſs into the worſhip of God under pretence of familiarity: but it ſeems very plain that the nature of that ordinance doth ſhadow out the intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between God and a godly ſoul.</p>
            <p>I have already in part prevented my ſelf, and ſhewed you wherein the ſouls communion with God conſiſts: But yet to give you a more diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this great myſterie, I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold it in theſe three following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A godly ſoul hath communion with God in his Attributes.</hi> When the Soul of man is molded and formed into a reſemblance of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then hath it a true fellowſhip with him. Now this communion with God in his <hi>Attributes</hi> is to be ſeen <hi>two</hi> wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:103119:180"/>1. <hi>When the ſoul is in its meaſure, according to the capacity of a creature, all that which God is.</hi> This is the communion which the <hi>Angels</hi> have with God: Their beholding of the face of God is not to be underſtood of a meer <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> or an idle gazing upon a Deity; but they ſee him, by receiving his Image upon themſelves, and reflecting his glory and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they partake of the goodneſs, purity, holineſs, wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, which makes them ſuch glorious ſpirits; and the want of this makes the other whom we call <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> to be what they are. Thus god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men <hi>ſhall have</hi> communion with God, they ſhall <hi>ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5. 8. Heb. 12. 14. Yea thus they <hi>have</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in ſome meaſure: They do not only ſee God in the <hi>world</hi> as the Devils do, nor ſee him in the <hi>word</hi> as many hypocritical and wicked men do, but they ſee him in <hi>themſelves,</hi> in the frame of their own ſouls, they find themſelves molded into his image, and a reſemblance of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:103119:181"/> him drawn upon them. This is a <hi>beautiful viſion</hi> of God <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> though not <hi>full</hi> and <hi>complete.</hi> This is ſet out in Scripture by being <hi>holy as God is holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 16. <hi>perfect as God is perfect,</hi> Mat. 5. ult. This our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our exhorts us to ſeek after <hi>Mat. 11. 29. take my yoke upon ye, learn of me for I am meek and lowly;</hi> and the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 1. Be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God as dear Children.</hi> When the nature and perfections of God, his holineſs, goodneſs, righteouſneſs, wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are coppyed out upon our natures, and the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> is in us, which was in Chriſt Jeſus, then have we a true communion with God, which bleſſed communion, when the ſoul becomes all that which God is by a conformity of nature!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When the ſoul in its actions as a creature, doth rightly anſwer to the Attributes of the Creator.</hi> As when the ſoul doth anſwer the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God with ſuitable aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>delight;</hi> when the ſoul doth correſpond to the <hi>Soveraignty</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:103119:181"/> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God by the Acts of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> and <hi>reſignation;</hi> doth converſe with the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of God by <hi>patience</hi> and a holy <hi>Acquieſcency.</hi> When the ſoul doth rightly exert thoſe Acts which are proper and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the nature of God, then it may be ſaid to hold communion with him in his attributes; when the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and notions of the ſoul do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to the divine nature and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. Now this ſuitableneſs of the ſoul I mean eſpecially with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the incommunicable attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, where there is no place for imitation, though it hold good in the reſt alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A godly ſoul hath communion with God in his word.</hi> To read, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs or hear the word is not to hold a real communion with God therein: many do ſo that are ſtrangers to God: A man may read my letters, and yet correſpond with my enemy. That Son in the Goſpel that heard his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers command, and anſwered, <hi>I goe ſir,</hi> but went not, had no right com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

            <p n="1">1.

Of all the Creatures, there was none found that could be a meet help for <hi>Adam,</hi> that could be taken into the humane ſociety, till <hi>Eve</hi> was made, who was a humane perſon.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:103119:186"/> a holy godlike diſpoſition whither ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This communion with God</hi> which I have been ſpeaking of <hi>is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all outward acts and enjoyments, duties and ordinances whatſoever, though they be never ſo many or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> God himſelf long ſince decided this matter that a <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>contrite</hi> heart is better than all Sacrifices, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. that to obey was better than Sacrifice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22. that mercy was better than Sacrifice, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. that to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God was to be preferred before thouſands of Rams and ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyle, <hi>Mie.</hi> 6. 7, 8. It holds in reference to <hi>Goſpel duties,</hi> though they may ſeem more ſpirituall, than the oblations of the Law. A real ſoul-communion with God, a communion of hearts and natures, of wills and affections, of intereſts and ends is infinitely more excellent than all <hi>hearing, praying, celebration of Sabboths</hi> or <hi>Sacraments, Jam.</hi> 1. 25. as the end is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:103119:187"/> than the means: For ſo ſtands the caſe between them.</p>
            <p>Yea I will add (though ſome proud and wanton ſpirits have made ſtrange work with it, yet) it is a ſure and moſt excellent doctrine, that this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual communion is a <hi>continual Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> (a Sabboth of <hi>communion</hi> is much better than a Sabboth of <hi>reſt:</hi>) this is the Sabboth that the Angels and Saints in Heaven keep, though they know no ſuch thing as a feaſt day in the week, have no reading, preaching, or praying amongſt them. This is a continual <hi>praying,</hi> an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual way of praying in ſilence. A right <hi>active ſucking faith</hi> dos vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contain a prayer in it; Right believing is powerful praying. The knees, eyes and tongues bear the leaſt ſhare in prayer, the whole of the work lyes upon the ſoul, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon faith in the ſoul, which is indeed the life and ſoul of prayer. Faith can pray without words; but the moſt elegant words, the phraſe of Angels is not worthy to be called
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:103119:187"/> prayer without faith. I ſpeak not ſo much of faith inditing a prayer, or giving life to it, as of its being vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prayer, if not ſomething more; for indeed faith is a real bringing down of that God, and ſucking in of thoſe influences into the ſoul, which prayer only looks up for.</p>
            <p>Communion with God is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>faſt,</hi> it is that ſpiritual and moſt excellent way of faſting, whereby the ſoul <hi>emptying</hi> it ſelf of it ſelf and all ſelf-fullneſs, ſelf-ſufficiency, ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence receives of the fulneſs of God alone, and is filled therewith. A ſoul communing rightly with God, is a ſoul emptied of, and as it were <hi>faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from it ſelf; which is the moſt excellent way of faſting.</p>
            <p>It is a continual <hi>thanksgiving;</hi> and indeed the beſt way of thankſgiving in the world. To render up our ſelves to God purely and entirely, to reflect the glory of God in an holy and godlike temper, is a real and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>thank-offering.</hi> This is that <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah,</hi> ſo much ſpoke of, which the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:103119:188"/> Angels and Saints in glory do ſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually: what other adjunct of it there may be, I will not here diſpute.</p>
            <p>This communion of hearts and wills is a conſtant and moſt excellent <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of Sacraments.</hi> The Soul that is really <hi>Baptized</hi> into the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus, and <hi>feeds</hi> upon God, and is one with him, keeps a continual <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi> without which, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> is but a jejune and dry devotion. In a word, it is not poſſible for any thing that is extrinſecal to the ſoul to make it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but the ſoul that is advanced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the noble ſtate of communion with God, is made partaker of a new nature, and is truly happy.</p>
            <p>Nay further I will add, that this communion with God is not only bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all duties and ordinances, but even better than all <hi>revelations, evidences, diſcoveries</hi> that can be made or given to the ſoul <hi>ab extra,</hi> all that are from without, a manifeſtation of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a divine life in the ſoul, is much better than ſuch a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:103119:188"/> as <hi>Moſes</hi> had of his glory in the cleft of the Rock, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. Many think, oh if they might but be aſſured of the love of God, of the pardon of fin, of an intereſt in Chriſt, they ſhould be happy: why I will tell you, if you had a voice from Heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ye were the beloved Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, as Chriſt had; an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſent from God to tell you that ye were beloved and highly favoured of God, as his Mother <hi>Mary</hi> had, yet were communion with God to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before theſe: For theſe things could not make a ſoul happy without real communion with God, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God can and doth make a ſoul happy without theſe: And to this purpoſe I ſuppoſe I may apply that famous ſpeech of our Saviour's by way of alluſion, <hi>It is more bleſſed to give, than to receive,</hi> to <hi>give up</hi> ones ſelf, ones heart, will, intereſts and affections to God, than to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> any external diſcoveries and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations from him. Why do we ſo earneſtly ſeek after ſigns from
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:103119:189"/> without us of Gods preſence with us; as if there were any thing better or more deſirable to the ſoul than <hi>Emanuel</hi> God with us, or as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, Chriſt in us the hope of glory? He that deſires any other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of grace, but more grace, dos not only light up a candle to ſee the Sun by, but indeed he acts like one that thinks there is ſomething better than God himſelf; though I do not ſay that all do think ſo who are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of ſuch manifeſtations. But this I will ſay, and you may do well to chew upon it, that holy longings after a true and ſpiritual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God do certainly ſpring from a divine principle in the ſoul; whereas a thirſt after <hi>aſſurance</hi> of Gods love, and reconciliation of our perſons with him, may be only the fruit of ſelf-love and intereſt.—<hi>Let me dye the death of the Righteous!</hi> you know whoſe wiſh it was.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Though communion with God do concern the whole ſoul, and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, affections, and motions of it,</hi>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:103119:189"/> (it is Gods ſpreading his influences and exerciſing his Soveraignty over all the powers of the ſoul, and their mutual ſpending of themſelves upon him and conforming to him,) <hi>yet the great Acts of the ſoul whereby it chiefly holds communion with God are loving and Believing. Love</hi> is the joyning and knitting of the ſoul to God; <hi>Faith</hi> is the ſouls labouring after more intimate conjunction with him, a ſucking in influences from him, and participations of him into the Soul. We may ſay that faith <hi>fetches</hi> in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from Heaven, and Love <hi>enjoyes</hi> them; faith <hi>ſucks</hi> in ſweetneſs and vertue from Chriſt, and love <hi>feeds</hi> upon it. Certainly theſe two emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent graces grow, and live, and thrive together, and are inſeparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. It is ſomewhat difficult to diſtinguiſh them, or to aſſign to each his proper place and work in the ſoul; they ſeem mutually to <hi>act,</hi> and to be mutually <hi>acted</hi> by each other: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Apoſtle might have reſpect to this myſtery, when he ſpeaks ſo
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:103119:190"/> doubtfully, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which words may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, either Faith <hi>acting</hi> by love, or faith <hi>acted</hi> by love. We know indeed that in the ſtate of perfect commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (which we call glory) love ſhall abide and flouriſh more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and there ſhall be no room for faith there, not as to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal act of it; but whether hath the greater part in maintaining our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in this world, is not eaſie, nor indeed needfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. The godly ſoul is the moſt proper <hi>Temple</hi> wherein God dwelleth, according to that, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. Ye are the Temple of the living God;</hi> Faith and Love are the <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> the two great <hi>Pillars</hi> which keep up the Soul as a Temple, take away theſe, and it remains a ſoul indeed, but the ſoul dos not remain a Temple to the Lord. In a word, theſe two are the ſouls principal handmaids which ſhe uſeth about this bleſſed gueſt; Faith goes out and brings him in, and Love entertains him; by faith ſhe finds
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:103119:190"/> him, whom ſhe ſeeks, and by love ſhe kiſſes him whom ſhe finds, as the ſpouſe is deſcribed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>The communion that is between God and the godly Soul is altogether different from that communion that is between creatures.</hi> Here I might ſhew you how it exceeds and excells that, in many reſpects; but I ſhall not inſiſt upon any of thoſe particulars, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed upon any of thoſe many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that are between them, ſave only upon this one: The communion that is between creature and creature is perfect in its kind, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gives mutual ſatisfaction; I mean it terminates the expectations, ſo that nothing remains to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them more than what is enjoyed. The creature is ſhallow and ſoon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed, we ſoon come to the bottom of it: A finite can graſp a finite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enjoy it, as I may ſay, all at once. A man may come ſo near to his friend that he can come no nearer, enjoy him as fully as he is capable to enjoy, or the other to be enjoyed:
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:103119:191"/> Created ſweetneſs may be exhauſted to the very bottom. But the ſouls communion with God dos not give it any ſuch ſatisfaction, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in ſome ſenſe, it gives a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a much higher and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent kind. I told you before that the ſouls communion with God is imperfect in this life, and therefore it muſt needs follow that it cannot ſatisfie; that is, not terminate and fill up the deſires of it. Communion with God is maintained by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi> as you have heard, which proves it to be very ſweet; but it alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>Hope,</hi> which proves it to be not ſatisfactory: For where there is yet any place left for hope, there is no full or ſatisfactory enjoyment. This may ſerve as a certain note whereby to judge of the truth of that communion with God; it is not <hi>glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> to the ſoul, but will certainly manifeſt it ſelf in inceſſant hungrings; <hi>inter opes inops,</hi> the ſoul is in the midſt of plenty, and yet cryes out as if it were ready to ſtarve for want.

I am ready to cry out <hi>Aut hic non eſt Apoſtolus aut hi non ſunt Apoſtolici;</hi> But an Apoſtle he was, and had very intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Lord, and therefore I confeſs I cannot allow theſe men ſo high a place in my opinion as they have in their own. God is infinite, and therefore though the ſoul may be ever graſping, yet it can never comprehend; and yet the ſoul finds him to be infinitely good, and ſo cannot ceaſe graſping him neither. The godly ſoul ſees that there is yet much more to be enjoyed of God,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:103119:192"/> and in him; and therefore though it be very near to him, yet cryes out and complains of its diſtance from him,—Oh when ſhall I come and appear before him! though it be united to him, yet it longs to be yet more one with him ſtill, to be in a cloſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. The godly ſoul forgets with <hi>Paul</hi> what it hath received, not through diſingenuity and unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but through a holy ardour and covetouſneſs: All that he has of God ſeems little, becauſe there is yet ſo much to be had. Though the godly ſoul do drink of the fountain, yet that is not enough, it would lye down by it; though it do lye down by it, yet ſo it is not ſatisfied neither, except it may bath it ſelf, and even be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up therein. Behold a Paradox, the godly ſoul is moſt thirſty, though according to Chriſts promiſe, it thirſt no more: it is moſt reſtleſs, though according to his promiſe it have reſt. It is proper to God alone to reſt in his love, for the creature cannot in this imperfect ſtate: By this we know
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:103119:192"/> that we are not yet in Heaven, for it is a ſtate of perfect reſt, not ſloth or <hi>ceſſation,</hi> but <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> Faith is the Feaver of the ſoul, rendring it more thirſty by how much the more it drinks in of the Water of Life, the living ſtreams that flow forth from the Throne of God and of the Lamb. As the Waters of the Sanctuary are deſcribed by the Prophet growing deeper and deeper, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. ſo <hi>hope</hi> which is the ſouls <hi>appetite</hi> grows larger and larger, and cannot be ſatisfied till the ſouls capacity be filled up.</p>
            <p>The Doctrinal part being thus briefly diſpatcht, it will be eaſie to inferr ſome things by way of coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary. I ſhall content my ſelf with three only amongſt many.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All wicked men are ſtrangers to God.</hi> We know indeed that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite eſſence is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with all his creatures: not only men but even devils too have their being in him, he hath ſpread his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence as the foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:103119:193"/> the whole Creation doth ſtand; he reared up the world in himſelf, and in him it doth ſubſiſt at this day. However Angels and men have ſadly fallen from God, yet they may be truly ſaid to live in him ſtill; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all wicked ſouls do ſtraggle off from God as to their <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> ingrafting themſelves into another ſtock by ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet they cannot poſſibly ſtraggle from him as to their <hi>ſubſiſtence,</hi> as the Apoſtle teaches the Athenian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Act. 17. 27. <hi>He is not far from every one of us,</hi> though few feel after him or find him. And it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid in ſome ſenſe, that all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yea the very worſt of them, have a communion with God, all partake of him, no creature hath any thing of its own really diſtinct from him. Every thing that hath a <hi>Being,</hi> hath a relation to that infinite and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream <hi>Being,</hi> and every <hi>living</hi> thing may be rightly ſaid to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him who is <hi>life</hi> it ſelf. And all thoſe ſeveral excellencies that are
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:103119:193"/> in the Creatures, are effluxes from God, who hath derived various prints of his own beauty and perfection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every thing that he hath made. Gods making of a thing is no other than the communicating of himſelf thereunto. And therefore when you look into the world, do not view any creature in the narrow point of its own Being, but in the unbounded eſſence of God, and therein love and admire it. But upon the immortal ſoul of man, God hath coppyed out his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections more clearly and gloriouſly than upon any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this world. God could not make a rational ſoul without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of his own infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, life, freedom unto it: ſo that there is more of the Divine nature to be ſeen in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of any one man, than in the whole fabrick of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, wicked men are ſtrangers to God. They live and move in God indeed, but they know
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:103119:194"/> it not, they conſider it not; they act as if they had no <hi>dependance</hi> upon him, no <hi>relation</hi> to him. Though they have ſome kind of communion with God as Creatures, yet this makes them not at all happy; for they are departed from God in their affections and diſpoſitions, they have degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from that ſubſerviency and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the Divine Will which is the proper perfection of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. It is not the ſouls moving <hi>in</hi> God that makes it truly and happily nigh unto him, but its moving <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> God as the chief <hi>object,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will</hi> of God, as the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>rule,</hi> and therefore wicked men who pitch upon other objects, and walk by other laws, even the luſts and ordinances of their own fleſh and fancy, are properly ſtrangers to God and miſerable. He is not properly ſaid to know God, who hath a notion of him formed in his head, but he whoſe heart and will is molded into a
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:103119:194"/> conformity to God, and a delight in him; ſo that a wicked man, though he <hi>know</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>tremble</hi> as much as any of the Devils, yet not loving nor delighting in him as his chiefeſt good, not being conformed to his Image, as the higheſt and pureſt perfection, may be truly ſaid to be eſtranged from God; which is a ſtate of hell and death and darkneſs. This is the man who though not in words, yet interpretatively and really ſaith unto God, Depart from me, I deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes, with them in <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14. Theſe do really exempt themſelves from the dominion of Chriſt, and do <hi>really,</hi> though not <hi>audibly,</hi> ſay with them in the Goſpel, Luk. 19. 14. <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men pretend to, and boaſt of their relation to, and acquaintance with God, certainly all that live a meer ſenſual life, <hi>non-conformiſts</hi> to the image of God, are truly ſaid to be ſtrangers to him, and in a ſtate of <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion</hi> with him. 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 6. 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:103119:195"/>2. <hi>The life of a true Chriſtian is the moſt high and noble life in the world;</hi> it exceeds the life of all other men, even of the greateſt of men. The character that is here given of the godly man is the higheſt that can be given of any <hi>man,</hi> or indeed of any <hi>creature.</hi> It is the higheſt glory and excellency of the creature to partake of the life of God, of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Creator; and ſuch is the deſcription that the ſpirit of God here makes of the godly man. What an unreaſonable and ſenſeleſs reproach is that which this wicked world doth caſt upon Religion, calling it a low and deſpicable thing, and upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and godly men, calling them low ſpirited, puny people. Can a man be better <hi>ſpirited,</hi> than with the <hi>ſpirit of God?</hi> Can any thing more truly <hi>ennoble</hi> a ſoul than a <hi>divine</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Can a man be raiſed any <hi>higher</hi> than unto <hi>Heaven it ſelf?</hi> So noble is the godly ſoul, Prov. 15. 24. <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe;</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all wicked men lead a low
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:103119:195"/> life, and are bound under chains of death and darkneſs: The righteous man is of a high and divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal born of God, born from above, and therefore is more excellent than his neighbour, than any of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, even a King himſelf being judge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 26. What a helliſh baſeneſs is that ſinful gallantry of ſpirit, what a brutiſhneſs is that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality of living, which the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> do ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie! True goodneſs and excellency of ſpirit muſt be meaſured by the proportion that it bears to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream good, the infinite pattern of all perfection. What excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were thoſe renowned Saints of old, <hi>of whom</hi> the Apoſtle ſayes, that <hi>the world was not worthy,</hi> Heb. 11. 38. however they were thought <hi>not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live in the world.</hi> What a noble and generous ſpirit of true Chriſtian valour, patience, meekneſs, contempt of the world and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal was that, which was to be ſeen in the bleſſed Apoſtles, however they
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:103119:196"/> were eſteemed as the filth and ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the world, the <hi>off-ſcouring of all things?</hi> To which of the noble, wiſe, mighty men of the world, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> did God ever ſay, theſe <hi>as</hi> the men that have fellowſhip with me, theſe are the men that lead a noble and divine life? No no, <hi>not many noble are called;</hi> and when they are called, they are made more noble, than ever they were by birth or deſcent, by places of preferment or command. The life of every wicked man, of what rank or ſize ſoever he be in the world, is but a low life, a life in moſt things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the very beaſts with him; If the main of his buſineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light be to eat, and drink, and work, and ſleep, and enjoy ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, what doth he? what enjoyeth he more than <hi>the beaſts that periſh?</hi> But the life of the meaneſt ſoul that hath true and ſpiritual communion with God, is a life common to him with the bleſſed Angels, thoſe <hi>ſons of the morning,</hi> the flower of the whole
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:103119:196"/> Creation. That life which hath <hi>ſelf</hi> for its <hi>centre,</hi> muſt needs be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious and indeed a painfull life: For how can the ſoul of man poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly feed to the full upon ſuch ſpare diet, ſuch ſcant fare as it finds at home? Nay indeed how can it chooſe but be in pain and torture; whileſt it ſtretcheth itſelf upon a <hi>ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,</hi> or <hi>creature-fulneſs</hi> which is not at all commenſurate to it? But the ſoul that rightly ſtretches and ſpends all its faculties upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and bleſſed God, finds all its capacities filled up to the brim with that fountain of goodneſs, and it ſelf perfectly matcht with a ſuitable and ſatisfactory object. This is the true and only nobleneſs of ſpirit, when all the powers and faculties of this immortal ſoul are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and advanced into a true and vital ſympathy and communion with the chiefeſt good, formed according to his will, conformed to his image.</p>
            <pb n="346" facs="tcp:103119:197"/>
            <p>And oh that wiſdom might be more <hi>juſtified of her children!</hi> Oh that the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did but clearly manifeſt it ſelf and ſhine forth in the <hi>lives</hi> of them that call themſelves <hi>godly!</hi> Alas that ever God himſelf ſhould ſuffer reproach by reaſon of the low-ſpiritedneſs and lazineſs of his ſervants! For this cauſe is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion evil ſpoken of; The Lord awaken and ennoble us to expreſs and ſhew forth the divine life with all power and vigour, to live as high as the calling wherewith we are called, and ſo roll away this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The life of a Chriſtian is not a heavy ſluggiſh thing, but active and vigorous,</hi> as the phraſe communion with God imports. Religion is a communication of life and vigour from him who is life it ſelf; which makes the truly godlike ſoul to be quick and powerfull in its motions. Every thing is by ſo much the ſwifter and ſtronger in its motions, by how much the nearer it is to its centre,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:103119:197"/> as Philoſophy tells us. Certainly by how much the nearer any man is gotten to God who is the center of ſouls, by ſo much the more do's he covet after more intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and the more eagerly lay hold upon him. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion do's neceſſarily imply <hi>reacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>reflection:</hi> the ſoul that <hi>receives</hi> of God and his fulneſs, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>emptying</hi> it ſelf into him again. Communion in the very force of the phraſe implies a <hi>mutualneſs;</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe a ſoul partaking of God, but it muſt needs mutually render up it ſelf to him again. There can be no commerce nor correſpondence without <hi>returns:</hi> but what return can the godly ſoul make unto God, why it renders up its whole <hi>ſelf</hi> unto him? Faith is a <hi>giving</hi> grace as well as a <hi>receiving,</hi> it gives up the ſoul back to Chriſt, as well as take Chriſt into the ſoul, it ſucks in ſtrength and grace from God, and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpends the ſame and the whole powers of the ſoul upon him.

            <p>Communion with God ſpeaks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing divine, active, vigorous. The life of a Chriſtian doth not conſiſt only in ceſſation from evil, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſin, or dying thereunto; <hi>Mortification</hi> is but one part of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</hi> It is the conceit, and I doubt the deceit of many nominal Chriſtians, that if they can but keep up an indifferent even ſpirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation free from groſs and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſins from day to day, they are happy enough, their utmoſt ambition is to be <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>harmleſs.</hi> This indeed is neceſſary and praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; but ſurely the happineſs of a ſoul lyes higher: Thus happy are all the Creatures that keep in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and keep up the order preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them of God: Thus happy is the Sun in the Firmament running his race continually, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the office which is aſſigned to it. But the ſoul of man is capable of a higher kind of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, viz. <hi>communion with God;</hi> which is, when the faculties thereof
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:103119:202"/> being awakened, refined and acted by the ſpirit of God, do reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act and ſpend themſelves upon him, longing to be perfectly ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in him, and to be all that which God himſelf is, as far as the Creature is capable to drink in the perfections of the Creator, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with his Maker. This is that truly noble and divine life, which is here called communion with God, which the high-ſpirited and generous ſoul labours yet more and more to be growing up into, and perfected in. Keep your ſelves with <hi>David</hi> from your iniquities; it is ſomething to be freed from the guilt and power of ſin; but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher than this, a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent attainment, a more divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, go on therefore with the ſame <hi>David,</hi> and aſpire after this pure and bliſsful ſtate, this Heaven upon earth, waiting for the more ample and glorious manifeſtations of God to you, and in you, more than they that watch for the morning, as he

            <p n="1">1. Our fellowſhip <hi>is,</hi> It reproves them that can take up with a <hi>ſhall be,</hi> a Heaven to come.

And is there any reaſon to be given, but why that <hi>new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and divine principle, which God putteth into regenerate ſouls, ſhould carry them as haſtily and forcibly to a preſent fruition of their proper object and happineſs, (ſo far as at preſent it may be enjoyed,) as that corrupt and degenerate nature doth hurry on them, in whom it ruleth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſatisfaction of their beaſtly luſts? Divines ſpeak ſometimes of making Heaven and eternal life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our ſelves, and ſay that this is the work of faith; which is an high and excellent doctrine, but I doubt, not thoroughly underſtood by ordinary Chriſtians. To make Heaven preſent to ones ſelf, is not only to inſiſt upon a ſtate of future happineſs in frequent meditations, to think much of it, neither is this that noble employment of ſaving faith: But the life and power of faith is moſt eminently exerted in ſucking in participations of life and grace from Chriſt, and in a real
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:103119:205"/> bringing down of God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Soul. The truth is, <hi>Heaven</hi> is a ſtate of perfect commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, a ſtate of <hi>love, joy, peace, purity, freedome;</hi> and as far as any ſoul is in ſuch a ſtate <hi>upon earth,</hi> ſo far he is <hi>above the earth,</hi> and may be ſaid to be in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Therefore a right active ſoul, that truly underſtands his proper and ſpiritual Heaven and happineſs; ſo far as he is thus act ve and ſenſible, cannot be content to ſtay for all his happineſs till the world to come, cannot be content to be unhappy, no not for an hour, but ſtill growing up in God, and ſpringing up into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It reprehends them that make a ſtir about the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> in the world, and mens being brought into the <hi>communion of the Church,</hi> but advance not his Kingdom in their <hi>own ſouls,</hi> nor long not to have their own ſouls advanced into that noble ſtate of communion with <hi>the Father, and with his Son Jeſus
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:103119:205"/> Chriſt.</hi> There is doubtleſs a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch <hi>popular Chriſtians,</hi> who being ſtrangers to the life, and power, and ſpirit of true Religion, do endeavour to put off themſelves to the world, and commend themſelves to the charity of their brethren, by a pretended zeal for the Kingdom of Chriſt in the world, and <hi>the glorious manifeſtation</hi> of it, as they ſpeak. I know indeed that it is worthy the cares and prayers and utmoſt diligence of every ſerious Chriſtian, to ſpread and propagate the knowledge of the Goſpel, to pour out the oyntment of Chriſts name far and near: A more pure and ſpiritual adminiſtration of all Goſpel ordinances throughout the world is bighly deſirable; yea and I think an indifferent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſpoſition towards the worſhip of God argues much of an earthly and atheiſtical mind. But I fear that <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and thoſe <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manifeſtations</hi> and <hi>diſcoveries</hi> which are ſo much pretended to by
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:103119:206"/> many, if they ſhould be throughly examined, would be at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into nothing elſe but the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of ſome one party or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt above all the reſt,</hi> or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of an old <hi>form</hi> and <hi>dreſs</hi> of Religion for a new one; and that this <hi>zeal</hi> would be found little better than the <hi>blazings</hi> of ſelf-love, a fire kindled not by a <hi>coal from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> but by a <hi>ſpark</hi> of their own. But be it ſo, that this diſpoſition of theirs is ſincere and ſpiritual; ſhould not this <hi>charity</hi> begin at home? The moſt proper <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> is that whereby he ruleth in the hearts of men; the moſt excellent <hi>Worſhip</hi> is when the ſoul it ſelf becomes a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> for the living God to dwell in, and to receive and reflect the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of his glory, when a <hi>fire</hi> of Divine love is kindled in it, and therein it doth <hi>offer</hi> up, not <hi>bulls</hi> and <hi>goots,</hi> no nor 10 much <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>meditations,</hi> as indeed <hi>it ſelf</hi> unto God, which is a <hi>reaſonable ſervice</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, far more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men may pretend, no man can be truly and rightly ſtudious of the advancement of the Kingdom of God in the world, that hath not firſt felt the mighty power and bleſſed effects of it in his own ſoul. Communion with the Church is only ſo far to be valued, as it lyes in order to a real and ſpiritual communion with God; which communion with God, if we do indeed ſincerely wiſh to others, we ſhall more abundantly labour to promote in our ſelves. I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he doth heartily ſeek the happineſs of others, who himſelf ſits ſtill and is content to be miſcrable, eſpecially when their happineſs and his is one and the ſame.</p>

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:103119:207"/> to have fellowſhip with God; it muſt needs follow then, that thoſe degenerate ſouls that riſe no higher than the world, that converſe only with ſelf or any other creature, are verily ſtrangers to true Chriſtianity, whatever their confidence or preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption may be. Chriſtians, tell not me what you profeſs of Chriſt, what you believe of the Goſpel, what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox <hi>opinions</hi> you hold, what an honeſt <hi>party</hi> you ſide with, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſpecious <hi>duties</hi> you perform, no nor what <hi>hopes</hi> or <hi>wiſhes</hi> you have of going to Heaven; But tell me, where is your principal <hi>communion;</hi> what do you mainly mind, follow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with; what pattern do you conform to; what rule do you live by, what object do you ultimately aim at? The whole world of worldly men doth haſten after <hi>another God,</hi> as the Pſalmiſts Phraſe is, though not all after the ſame God; they ſpend their ſouls indeed upon various objects, and uſe different methods to obtain reſt, but yet all their happineſs and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:103119:207"/> contentment is ultimately reſolved into <hi>creature-communion.</hi> That dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence, that the Apoſtle delivers univerſally concerning all men, is to be limited to all wicked men only, and of them it is undoubtedly true, <hi>Phil. 2. 21.

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:103119:210"/> elſe, but a ſtrict obſervance of the precepts of the law, according to the <hi>letter</hi> and <hi>external diſpenſation</hi> of it.
